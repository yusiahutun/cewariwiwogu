Plus, Our Favorite PETA-Friendly Celebs" href=#>activists</a>, social media stars, and so much more. They might differ in field, but these iconic celebrity couples have one definitive thing in common—power.</p><p>We’ve collected&nbsp;five of the&nbsp;most buzzed-about&nbsp;famous couples of our generation, and made a case for why they matter in more ways than keeping us entertained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wenn213203281.jpg><h2>Beyoncé and Jay Z</h2><p>Apart from being two of the most beloved&nbsp;performers in the music industry, Bey and Jay have their hands in just about every element of show business. Both are responsible for some of the most revered&nbsp;records in the history of music—from&nbsp;The Black Album&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a title="Surprise! Beyoncé Dropped Her Album Without Announcing It First" href=#>Beyonce</a>.&nbsp;As a unit, their skills are pretty incredible: They can sing, rap, dance, produce, arrange and write music.&nbsp;Jay has also produced and launched the careers of several other artists, including <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_kanye-west data-tag=kanye-west>Kanye West</a></strong>.</p><p>Outside of music, Beyoncé is a poster girl&nbsp;for choosing campaigns wisely: She’s been the <a href=# rel=nofollow>face of L’Oreal</a> since she was 18 years old and has worked with powerhouse brands&nbsp;like American Express and <a href=# rel=nofollow>Pepsi</a>. She also recently signed a deal with <a title="Beyoncé is Teaming Up With Topshop for a Line of Athletic Streetwear" href=#>Topshop to help launch an athleticwear line.</a></p><p>The couple is also involved with philanthropic ventures: After Hurricane Katrina, Beyoncé—along with former&nbsp;Destiny’s Child member <strong>Kelly Rowland—</strong>started a charity titled “Survivor Foundation” to help provide housing for victims. <a href=# id=auto-tag_jay-z data-tag=jay-z>Jay Z</a> also donated funds&nbsp;and support to Hurricane Katrina relief through the <a href=# rel=nofollow>American Red Cross</a>.</p><p>They’re also close friends of&nbsp;<strong>The Obamas</strong> and provided much support, both verbally and financially, to the First Family during both of&nbsp;<a title="Beyoncé Performed at Michelle Obama’s 50th Birthday Party: See the Photos" href=#>the President’s campaigns</a>,&nbsp;publicly backing&nbsp;his&nbsp;policies, including his support of same-sex marriage.</p><p>Collectively valued at over $1 billion, the couple was named the wealthiest couple in entertainment by <a href=# rel=nofollow>Forbes magazine</a>, but&nbsp;their influence extends far beyond financials—they’re uniformly well-liked, which is rare for folks as famous as they are. Even a small PR hiccup—<a title="Pop Culture in 2014: An A to Z Guide" href=#>that mysterious elevator fight</a>—was merely a blip on their pristine public record.</p><p>Oh, and the fact that they have an adorable <a title="Beyoncé and Blue Ivy Wear Matching Dolce & Gabbana Dresses" href=#>baby daughter</a>&nbsp;doesn’t hurt their image, either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wenn22155774.jpg><p>Love ’em or hate ’em,<strong> Kim Kardashian</strong> and <strong>Kanye West</strong> are a pop culture&nbsp;force to be reckoned&nbsp;with.&nbsp;At a collective 42.4 million twitter followers, plus Kim’s 28.8 million Instagram followers, their social media reach—which translates to influence—is untouchable and astronomical.</p><p>Of course, Kanye has experienced huge success in the music world independent of any&nbsp;connection to his wife’s reality TV family. His 2008 opus&nbsp;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&nbsp;was named the best album of the 21st century by <a href=# rel=nofollow>GQ Magazine</a>. He’s also a respected producer, having worked&nbsp;on albums and songs for the likes of <strong>Alicia Keys</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Rihanna</strong>, and <strong>Lorde</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to name a few.</p><p>Kanye’s also a noted fashion, art, and design lover, often putting art-world names on the public’s radar. And he’s persistent when it comes to creating his own fashion line—after a not-so-successful go at it in 2011, he recently re-entered the design&nbsp;world via&nbsp;a&nbsp;collaboration with Adidas for <a title="What Went Down At Kanye West’s Adidas Fashion Week Debut" href=#>Yeezy Season One</a>, which was a highlight of the Fall 2015 fashion month circuit.</p><p>Kim, despite generally being more infamous than famous is—for better or worse—one of the most influential women of our generation. Financially, she’s made millions endorsing a boatload of products, has a successful chain of clothing boutiques with her sisters, and has one of the most successful apps on the market, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, which in 2014, made&nbsp;$43.4 million from&nbsp;July 1 to September 30.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest validation of their influence came in March 2014,&nbsp;<a title="It Happened: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Landed the Cover of Vogue" href=#>when they were featured on the cover of Vogue</a>. Not only was this the first time the high-fashion glossy featured a reality star or a rapper on the cover—let alone both together—the pair were the first interracial couple to land the cover.</p><p>Unlike, say, Beyoncé and Jay Z, this couple is powerfully divisive: Some people&nbsp;<a title="Some Genius Made Loser.com Redirect to Kanye West’s Wikipedia Page" href=#>despise&nbsp;them</a>&nbsp;with a burning passion and think they&nbsp;represent the worst of today’s society, while&nbsp;others consider them the epitome of a <a href=# rel=nofollow>modern celebrity couple</a>. Whichever side you migrate toward, you can’t deny that these two are beacons of &nbsp;our current cultural moment. Whether that’s good for bad, of course, is up for debate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wenn214031751.jpg><p><strong>Brad</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Pitt</strong> and <strong>Angelina Jolie&nbsp;</strong>are the definitions of movie stars, each wildly famous and successful in their own right. The bankable actors have starred in and produced some of the best movies of our&nbsp;time, including “Girl Interrupted,” “Fight Club,” “Thelma &&nbsp;Louise,” “Moneyball,” and “12 Years a Slave.”</p><p>Apart from their day jobs, these two are known for their dedication to philanthropy and human rights work. Angie adopted their first two children, Maddox and Zahara, from orphanages in Cambodia and Ethiopia respectively. Angie first met Maddox when she was on a film set in Cambodia as well as on a mission as a Goodwill Ambassador for the <a href=# rel=nofollow>UNHCR</a>. Soon after Angie and Brad got together, he adopted the two children.</p><p>Upon selling the first photos of their biological daughter Shiloh to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Getty Images</a>, the couple made over $7 million, which they then donated to several <a href=# rel=nofollow>charities benefiting impoverished&nbsp;children</a> in African countries. The couple also has three other children together, one adopted, and biological twins.</p><p>Angie is also particularly admired and respected for revealing publicly that she chose to undergo&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a title="Angelina Jolie Bravely Reveals She Had A Double Mastectomy" href=#>preventative&nbsp;double mastectomy</a> after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer, as well as her decision to remove <a title="Angelina Jolie Ruled the Kid’s Choice Awards With Moving Speech—and Adorable Daughters" href=#>her ovaries and fallopian tubes</a>.&nbsp; The two are also founders of the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jolie-Pitt Foundation,</a> a charitable organization that aids humanitarian initiatives across the world.</p><p>Their diverse family, successful careers, and <a title="Angelina Jolie Ruled the Kid’s Choice Awards With Moving Speech—and Adorable Daughters" href=#>positive reception by the media</a> makes the Jolie-Pitts one of the most iconic and current couples.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wenn21978888.jpg><h2><strong><strong>David and Victoria&nbsp;Beckham</strong></strong></h2><p>Whoever thought that a British footballer and a former&nbsp;<a title="Best News Ever: Baby Spice Hints at Spice Girls Reunion" href=#>Spice Girl</a> would make such an iconic&nbsp;couple? Not only have David and Victoria Beckham shed their solo identities of “Becks” and “Posh,” they’ve defied the celebrity couple curse, and continue to only get more famous, and become more successful.</p><p>Since the Spice Girls disbanded, Victoria made a name for herself as a&nbsp;highly respected fashion designer, nabbing the coveted CFDA award for&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>designer of the year</a>&nbsp;in 2011.&nbsp;She’s also a huge supporter of <a href=# rel=nofollow>PETA, and general animal rights</a>, as well as a&nbsp;representative of the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Ban Bossy</a> campaign, which aims to empower young girls.</p><p>After playing for major soccer teams, including Manchester United, Real Madrid, and the LA Galaxy, David embarked on several lucrative endorsement deals, including Coke, H&M, Samsung, and Armani. He was also named a Goodwill Ambassador, with a particular focus on <a href=# rel=nofollow>UNICEF’s&nbsp;Sports for Development</a> program.</p><p>The couple have four gorgeous&nbsp;children,&nbsp;and seem to epitomize the definition of a loving—and successful—family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wenn22327816.jpg><p><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong> and <strong>Portia de Rossi</strong> were both household names, but have become a pretty powerful unit since getting together.</p><p>As host of the “The Ellen Degeneres Show”—which&nbsp;been on the air since 2003, and has won over 25 Emmy awards—Ellen has also voiced several&nbsp;animated characters, acted in a few films, and&nbsp;<a title="Why Ellen’s Oscars Selfie is Worth Nearly $1 Billion" href=#>hosted the 2014 Oscars.</a></p><p>De Rossi, who is Australian born, is a successful actress and&nbsp;active philanthropist, supporting <a href=# rel=nofollow>Locks of Love</a> and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>FXB International</a>, an organization that helps children with AIDS in developing countries.</p><p>Ellen and&nbsp;Portia’s real influence, however, comes from the fact that they’re one of the first and only celebrity lesbian couples, frequently speaking about <a href=# rel=nofollow>LGBT issues</a>. The couple was&nbsp;married in 2008—right after the same-sex marriage ban was overturned in California—and were both well-known in their own right, but iconic as a pair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB%2FlGlqaW5fnrCwusicZJydnJqvs7XTsmScp6Wluaa%2FjK2fmqxdoq61wMSrZKanopp6tbTAp2Syp6Viwam1zaRm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sequin-outfits-1071067.html>&#171;&nbsp;7 Sequin Outfits That Don't Look Tacky AF</a>
