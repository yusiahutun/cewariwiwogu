But what is it, exactly?</p><p><span>White—whose full name is Shaun Roger White—was born on September 3, 1986 in San Diego, California. When he was a baby, White underwent three open-heart surgeries to treat a heart condition known as Tetralogy of Fallot, which is a rare combination of four congenital heart defects. Thankfully, his surgeries were a success. The future Olympian enjoyed an active lifestyle as a child, growing up in Southern California alongside his family. White is the youngest of three siblings: he has a brother, Jesse, and a sister, Kari. Their mother Cathy was a waitress, while their father Roger, a former surfer, worked for the San Clemente water department. Together, the White family would often spend their time at the Bear Mountain and Okemo Mountain ski resorts—and it was here where White got his first introduction to snowboarding.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DVFxtargetreview.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question4_FI.jpg><p><span>It didn’t take long for White to attract attention. By the time he was 7 years old, White was already winning snowboarding competitions of his own and receiving sponsorship deals. Around the same time, White took up skateboarding. He met professional skateboarder Tony Hawk when he was 9 years old at the YMCA skate park in Encinitas, California, and Hawk went on to befriend and mentor the young skateboarder. “Tony never really sat me down and said you should do this or do that. He was always leading by example,” White said in 2020. “It was just so awesome to be around somebody gaining this level of success, going through things I was just about to go through myself.”</span></p><p><span>With Hawk’s help, White was officially a pro skateboarder by the time he was 17. Since then, White has gone on to win several titles for skateboarding, including the overall title of Action Sports Tour Champion. His skills in the sport also allowed him to become the first person to ever compete in and win both the Summer and Winter X Games in two different sports.</span></p><p><span>While his talents at the skate park are no joke, it is his skill on the slopes that continues to command the most interest by fans and sponsors alike. Since going pro, White has won a number of awards as a snowboarder. When he was 16, White won the U.S. Open Snowboarding Championship, making him the youngest athlete to do so. Three years later, he won his first Olympic gold medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics. He went on to compete and represent the U.S. at the Winter Olympic Games in 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022. Meanwhile, in Europe, White also won the Austrian snowboarding contest Air & Style two years in a row in 2003 and 2004.&nbsp;</span></p><p>As if these accolades weren’t enough to stun you, just wait until you see Shaun White’s net worth.

The book, which was called an “indispensable Olympic resource” and “pure fun” by The New York Times, follows the history of the Olympics, from how it began in a Victorian English town called Much Wenlock to the discontinued sports that are no longer around like tug of war, firefighting, painting and, yes, live pigeon shooting. The bestseller, which features hundreds of true tales and historical photographs, also includes stories from both internationally known and little known athletes like gymnast Shun Fujimoto, who led his team to victory with a broken knee.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
