This included Joanne Froggatt, who looked beautiful in a bright red, one-shouldered gown, which was custom designed for her by Sabina Bilenko.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The dress – which took more than 200 hours to create – was a collaborative project between Froggatt, her stylist Holly White, and Bilenko. "We wanted to create an unforgettable moment that would make an impact but at the same time felt special to Jo personally," White explained. "A look that Jo would feel the most confident she has ever felt in. This gown does just that; it felt like Jo, even from the first sketch. The strength and elegance in Sabina's design are a perfect match for who Jo is."</p><img alt="joanne froggatt" title="Joanne Froggatt " width=2073 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/joanne-froggatt-attends-the-world-premiere-of-downton-abbey-news-photo-1650961037.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Samir Hussein</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for The best dressed from the Downton Abbey: A New Era premiere" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/downton2-1651054361.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it came to choosing what would help Froggatt to feel her very best self for this big red-carpet moment, Bilenko opted to make an impact with colour, and to channel elegance with the silhouette.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Joanne and Holly really wanted something strong and modern and as red is such a bold colour, we thought it was a perfect choice," the designer told us.

It feels like Downton Abbey: A New Era has come at the right moment to bring audiences some much-needed joy. When I saw the film it certainly did that for me; it made me laugh out loud and shed a tear. It felt like a warm hug and filled me with positivity. I think those moments of escapism can be good for us all and we wanted to celebrate that, and carry it through to the red carpet. That certainly informed our choice of style and colour."</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">HOW INVOLVED ARE YOU IN THE STYLING PROCESS?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I’m very involved with the styling process. Holly and I collaborate on everything. We have a really strong relationship and I trust her judgment implicitly. She will often suggest options that I wouldn’t have thought of, and they are usually brilliant. We are always on the same page, and when doing fittings with Holly, I’m very open and honest about what I feel good in. Holly understands that feeling good in an outfit is important; it helps you to be your most confident, comfortable self, no matter what the event or situation."</p><img alt="joanne froggatt" title="joanne froggatt" width=3667 height=5500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sabina-bilenko-x-joanne-froggatt-1-1650962142.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Sabina Bilenko</span></p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">HOW HAS YOUR STYLE EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My style has certainly evolved over the years – changes in fashion and myself as a person have informed that. Working with various great stylists over the last 12 years has helped develop my sense of individual style. My main concern is to always feel appropriate to the event, to feel great in what I am wearing, and for it to be a fun and enjoyable process."<br></p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">HOW HAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR STYLE, BODY, APPEARANCE CHANGED OVER THE YEARS?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I have definitely become more comfortable in my own skin over the years. I’ve learned which styles and cuts suit me and which don’t. I’m a petite person and I’ve learned to wholly embrace that and enjoy the positives of it. When I was a teenager, I was convinced that one day I was going to develop in to a tall, long-legged superhuman body, (I have no idea why, all my family are small) and when reality hit and I realised that was never going to happen, I decided to start seeing the benefits of being 5 ft 2 inches tall. I’ve reached a place in myself where I’m happy with the person I am, and I really believe that reflects on your outward appearance."<br></p><img alt="joanne froggatt" title="joanne froggatt" width=4010 height=6016 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/joanne-froggatt-4-1650962140.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bertie Watson</span></p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">HOW MUCH DOES THE PROJECT YOU’RE WORKING ON IMPACT THE OUTFIT YOU CHOOSE?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The project I’m working on always has a big impact on the outfits I choose. Again, for me it comes down to what’s appropriate. If I’m doing publicity for work that is based around a very serious or sensitive subject matter, I wouldn’t be arriving at my interviews in sequins and feathers. I doubt Holly would allow that in any circumstance actually. But I always circle back to what is appropriate for the subject matter and the event, and what makes me feel my most comfortable and able to tackle what’s in front of me."<br></p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR MOST MEMORABLE RED CARPET MOMENT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I actually think this one will be my most memorable for quite a few years. It was such a special experience to collaborate with Sabina on this custom gown. Sabina and her team were absolutely wonderful to work with, and I think we all thoroughly enjoyed the process. This gown feels very ‘me’. I love the colour, the cut is just perfect and I’ve been so excited to wear it and channel the positivity of the movie."<br></p><img alt="joanne froggatt" title="joanne froggatt" width=3397 height=2547 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/joanne-froggatt-8-1650962138.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bertie Watson</span></p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">WHOSE STYLE HAVE YOU ALWAYS ADMIRED AND WHY?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I’ve always loved Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham’s style. Victoria is always timeless with incredible tailoring. Kate’s style has been much more varied yet she has always been at the forefront of fashion. Even in my late teens, I would always follow what Kate Moss was wearing, or try to."</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH BRANDS TO WORK WITH?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It really just depends on what works and what I feel good in. I think variation is key.

Atmosphere is really important to me, I always want to work with good people with positive energy.

For me, fashion should be an expression of self, a way to put forward to the world whatever you want to, on any given day. We all need to be aware of how damaging fast fashion can be to the environment, so to me fashion shouldn’t mean throwaway fashion. Buying key pieces that last and that you can take care of and love is important to me. I own coats, bags and shoes that I have had for many years and I still love rediscovering them. I take care of my wardrobe. I also love buying vintage. I have a slight obsession with vintage cowboy boots and I love to mix old, new and designer. I want to feel like me, depending on my vibe, and not simply recreate a carbon copy of someone else’s style. I am influenced by new-season collections and I enjoy that, but it doesn’t mean that I have to buy constantly.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I like to keep my clothes, but when I do have a clear out, I always give to charity or pass on to my friends' daughters.
