Sunscreens that claim to provide “all-day protection” and “water resistance” are not reliable; don’t be fooled by these claims and reapply all sunscreens at least every 2-3&nbsp;hours.</p><p>75.

Rub them together. Next gently smooth the pomade over your curls and scrunch just a little bit.”— <strong>Eugene Davis</strong>, celebrity hair stylist</p><p>44.”You should always go to a hair-removal specialist, where waxing, laser etc. is their main business – don’t go to a nail salon for a wax”— <strong>Cindy Barshop</strong>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Completely Bare</a> and Bravo’s “RHONYC”</p><p>43.”A little silvery-blue eyeliner on the lower lid is very flirty.”— <strong>Dimitri James</strong>, makeup artist, author and creator of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Skinn Cosmetics</a></p><p>42.”Use your concealer as a base on your eyelids.”— <strong>Melissa Silver</strong>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maybelline</a> makeup artist.

For unwanted redness, use a color-depositer with a green tone.</p><p>33. To cover up roots in a hurry, use a dry shampoo spray for your hair color. If you don’t keep this product around, use eyeshadow (in a shade closest to your hair color) for a quick fix.</p><p>32. Get a “dewy glow” using a highlighter or illuminator above your cheekbones and on the brow bone, just underneath your eyebrows.</p><p>31. To contour cheeks, use a matte powder (a few shades darker than your skin tone) with an angled brush.

To reduce unwanted shine, use a moisturizer that mattifies your skin. That way you get the moisture your skin needs without looking greasy.</p><p>21. To create a lived-in look for your hair, use thickening or sea-salt mist before you blow-dry. Follow by running a volumizing or texture cream through hair.</p><p>20. When using an eyeshadow primer, only place the primer where you’ll be adding color.</p><p>19.”Cream rouge [blush] should be the first thing that touches your cheeks when you want to project an image of healthy and pinched cheeks.”— Pablo Manzoni, former creative director for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Elizabeth Arden</a></p><p>18. If you choose to use false eyelashes, remember to use the dark glue as it will blend in with the lashes.</p><p>17.
