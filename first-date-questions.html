different points in life, especially if you are ready to find someone you are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>truly compatible with</a>. So while heavy topics don’t lend themselves to a light and fun first date, many singles are prioritizing political beliefs and social justice issues when picking a partner—which means they're important to discuss early on so that you don't waste your time with someone you aren't compatible with.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to research <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>by psychologist Arthur Aron</a>, a key pattern associated with the development of a close relationship is “sustained, escalating, reciprocal personal self-disclosure.” In other words, to become and remain close, we must be open and forthcoming about our inner world. That said, you don’t want to reveal too much personal information too soon. The development of intimacy while dating should be gradual. If you are looking for a meaningful relationship, talking and getting to know each other over time is the best way to do that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before spilling your heart on the heavy stuff, the typical first date questions can be a good way to lead in. According to dating expert <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Patti Stanger</a>, (whom you may know from Bravo's Millionaire Matchmaker), one of the most important things to determine on a first date is if this person is someone you click with. You can ask fun, light questions about things like travel, food, hotels, restaurants, and preferences to get a sense of whether or not you are on the same page, share the same interests, and find each other intellectually stimulating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Looking for other topics to talk about on a first date to help you ease in and get to know your partner better? Start here.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-topics-for-a-first-date></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Topics for a First Date</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Travel</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Psychologist Richard Wiseman</a> found that talking about travel is a very successful dating topic. According to his research, couples who talked about travel wanted a second date 18 percent of the time, whereas those who talked about movies only wanted a second date nine percent of the time. Think about it: Movie conversations can get a little argumentative, while conversations about past adventures and exciting travels tend to make people seem more attractive to one another. A few fun questions to ask about travel are:</p><li>What amazing adventures have you been on?</li><li>What is the best vacation you’ve ever been on?</li><li>Where is a place you have always wanted to go to but have never been?</li><li>What place have you traveled to that was better than you expected?</li><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Passions</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Stanger points out, people tend to feel good when they talk about things they are passionate about — and in turn, feel good about their date. Asking questions about the things in their life that spark joy allows you to learn about your date and to see if your interests and values align. Some questions, along these lines, that you could ask are:</p><li>Are you working on any passion projects right now?</li><li>What's your favorite way to spend your free time?</li><li>Who is the most fascinating person you’ve met?</li><li>What hobbies would you get into if you had unlimited time and money?</li><li>What new skills have you learned or activities have you done recently?</li><li>What are you always game to do?</li><li>What is the most spontaneous thing you’ve ever done?</li><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Entertainment</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Entertainment-related topics are always a fun way to connect. They allow you to see if you have the same taste and intellectual interests, and they may even turn you on to something that you hadn't heard about.</p><li>What was the last book you really got into?</li><li>What TV series do you keep coming back to you and re-watching?</li><li>What was the last show you binge-watched?</li><li>What are your favorite apps on your phone?</li><li>What are your favorite podcasts?</li><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Career and Lifestyle</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Getting a bird’s-eye view of what a day in the life of your date typically looks like can help you figure out if you are compatible. If the idea of peeing in the woods makes you want to scream and your date loves to spend weekends camping, it's probably not going to be a match. If you were constantly getting annoyed at your last S.O. because they worked too much, finding out about your trauma surgeon date’s 80-hour workweek in advance can save you a lot of heartache. Some simple lifestyle compatibility questions you can ask are:</p><li>What is a typical workday like for you?</li><li>What about the weekends?</li><li>What is the most surprising thing that happened to you in the past week?</li><li>What drew you to your work?</li><li>Are you a morning person or a night owl?</li><li>What is your most important outlet to help you de-stress?</li><li>How much alone time do you tend to need?</li><li>Which do you prefer, big parties or small gatherings?</li><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Family, Friends, and Upbringing</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We can learn a lot about a person from the company they keep. The atmosphere we grew up in, our parents and siblings leave a lasting impression, so learning about those people in your date's life will give you valuable information. Also, social preferences, comforts, and discomforts can be very telling. Some questions you can ask in this area are:</p><li>Who are your closest friends and why?</li><li>What friendships have impacted you the most?</li><li>What was your relationship like with your parents growing up?</li><li>How close are you with them today (do you talk on the phone once a day, once a month)?</li><li>Where did you grow up?</li><li>How would your friends and family describe you as a kid? In high school?</li><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Relationship Goals and Priorities</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When looking for a long-term partner, you want to find out if the person at the table with you is looking for the same. It is also important to find out their views on relationships. In this day and age, you should never assume that the person you are on a date with wants <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>monogamy</a>. These are important questions to ask to help you find out about your date's relationship history and get a sense of what they're looking for in the future:</p><li>What are you looking for in a relationship?</li><li>What are your thoughts on monogamy?</li><li>Do you see yourself getting married?</li><li>If divorced, how did you like being married?</li><li>How long have you been single?</li><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Religion and Politics</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While we always hear that we should avoid talking about politics and religion, if you’re looking to spend your life with someone and these issues are important to you, you are going to want to touch on them during that first date. Ask questions that will give you a sense of how your date feels about issues that are important to you, without getting too intense and argumentative.</p><li>What religion were you raised in?</li><li>Is that religion still part of your life?</li><li>Do you consider yourself to be spiritual?</li><li>How do you feel about the upcoming election?</li><li>Have you ever had politics or religion end a relationship that was important to you?</li><li>Have you ever been to a protest or a rally?</li><li>What social justice issues are you most passionate about?</li><span class=heading-toc id=toc-first-date-donts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>First Date Don'ts</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here are a few topics that you should avoid on a first date—plus general tips for making the best impression.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Don’t Ignore the Red Flags</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Stanger, the two biggest reasons why people ignore red flags are because they are super attracted to their date or because they have already created the fantasy of the marriage they plan to have with this person. Keep your eyes wide open no matter how hot someone is.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Stay Away From Sex</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sex is super important in a relationship—after you get to know each other. Once you're with someone, understanding their preferences (and vice-versa) is super important, but you do not need to find this out on a first date. If you spend a lot of time talking about sex, you are not going to be getting to know each other intellectually and emotionally, which should be your focus on date one.</p><p>If your date pressures you to take things physical before you're comfortable, that is a red flag.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Don’t Talk Money</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, you want to make sure that the person in front of you is a hard worker or has the same priorities about saving as you do, but there are ways to go about this. Offering to split the bill if you are doing a dinner date, or seeing what they offer/suggest when it's payment time should tell you more about your compatibility than asking how much they're taking home.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Throw Away Your Checklist</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stanger says she sees too many people with a vision of what their future S.O. will look like on paper—so they rule out great prospective partners who don't have everything on the list. For example, you may want to reconsider how much weight you place on a specific college degree or a physical attribute.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Avoid "Yes" or "No" Questions</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Always ask open-ended questions. "Yes" or "no" questions tend to hit a brick wall pretty fast, while open-ended ones allow the conversation to keep flowing, even if either of you is nervous.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skip the Pick-Up Lines</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cheesy pick-up lines do not work. Most of us have heard them all, and they’re so generic that they do not make the receiver feel special at all.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>De-Stress Before the Date</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Take the time to clear your head and get relaxed before a date. If your boss yelled at you and you’re stressed out, you can’t stop obsessing about the pimple on your cheek, or you just had a fight with your mother, you will bring that energy into the date. Take the time to meditate, do some deep breathing, or whatever it takes for you to let the stress go.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-b7505e12-4b4f-4ec5-b56a-79d44ddba030></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How can I avoid awkward silence on a first date?</span></p><p>The best way to avoid awkward silence on a first date is to ask your date questions. Not only will it allow you to learn more about them but it will help to keep the conversation flowing. However, if your date isn't a big talker or is nervous, consider sharing a story. Also, it's okay if there are some moments of silence, especially if you're eating. Just try and relax.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How do I make my first date not awkward?</span></p><p>It's normal to be nervous for a first date, but try to go into it with a friendly and relaxed attitude (remember, you're there to have fun). If you're not a big talker, try to plan a date around an activity versus a meal. But also keep questions and topics on hand to ask your date and show that you're interested.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=3 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How do you know if a first date didn't go well?</span></p><p>Unless you're a pessimist or super self-critical, if you thought the first date went bad, you might be onto something. However, it's good to check in with how your date is behaving to see if they seem interested or not. If they're easily distracted, not asking you any questions to get to know you, and don't follow up following your date, it might be time to move on. Still, if you want things to continue, take the initiative. But if they're still unresponsive or don't seem excited to hear from you, it's probably not worth pursuing.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8WiqaysXZmutbGMqqyeq6SevK%2B%2F</p></div><div id=links><a href=./alexandra-espinoza-age-wiki-bio-net-worth-height-more.html>&#171;&nbsp;Alexandra Espinoza - Age Wiki, Bio, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a>
