She had thought that their shared sense of humor and exuberant personalities would make them a good match, but it didn’t work out because they both rejected her shortly after.</p><p>While Brennon established connections with Alexa Alfia, Cole had a genuine desire for a life companion who would not only match his banter but also go much deeper than that. Cole found all of it with Zanab Jaffrey.</p><p>At this point, the vivacious dancer made the decision to look into a potential relationship with Matt, especially since she had the sensation that “there’s something there. Like, I know there’s something there.”&nbsp;It was noteworthy that during their first genuine chat, she shared her concern about being exposed in the event of an injury, and he responded with his positive perspective.</p><p>He even revealed he is divorced after his high school girlfriend cheated and became pregnant as a result, which brought this couple closer together in his Matthew McConaughey-like drawl.</p><p>Matt soon admitted in a confessional, “With Colleen, I don’t know what it is, but it’s natural. I’ve opened up more to her than I have to anybody in the last ten years.” &nbsp;She contrasted this by saying, “With Matt…, I’m just so happy. And I’m so shocked that I’m feeling this way… In less than a week, I’m waking up smiling about him. I’m just so up in the clouds.”</p><p>They accepted that they had fallen in love because their aims, guiding principles, values, and expectations from their future families all lined up. Naturally, Colleen responded joyfully and emotionally when Matt finally got down on one knee to pop the question.</p><p>But are they still together?</p><p>Matt and Colleen’s journey to the altar is not without its challenges. A family member of Matt’s is heard telling Colleen in a teaser for the future episodes that “he loves, but he runs.” Additionally, Matt has a conversation with Cole Barnett, who once dated Colleen in the pods. When Matt asked Cole if he had any reservations, Cole advised him to be wary.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Matt Bolton Parents?</strong></h3><p>Matt Bolton was reportedly born to his mother Becky Fitzgerald.

But when Matt was 24, he and his high school sweetheart filed for divorce because of what was allegedly infidelity on his wife’s part. The news that his wife was allegedly carrying another man’s child broke his heart, but he made the decision to carry on and not give up on love.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Matt Bolton?</strong></h3><p>In 2022, Matt Bolton is 28 years old.
