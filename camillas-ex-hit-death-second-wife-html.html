Only a few months after their marriage, he was canvassing for votes in Sedgefield, County Durham, where Rosemary's daughter-in-law Lizzie Noel was trying to get a seat in Parliament&nbsp; -&nbsp; her opponent was Tony Blair.<br></p><p>In the years after their marriage&nbsp; -&nbsp; and particularly since Camilla has become Duchess of Cornwall&nbsp; -&nbsp; Andrew and the two wives in his life have become close friends. Camilla is almost certain to attend Mrs Parker Bowles's funeral.<br></p><p>Last night, Rosemary's son Henry, a former soldier, spoke of the family's pride at his mother's courage. 'It was a long, long illness but she was immensely brave, and bore her troubles with great strength and fortitude,' he tells me.<br></p><p>'She was especially pleased to reach Christmas and to be able to see her new step-grandchildren [the twin boys born to Andrew and Camilla's daughter Laura on New Year's Eve].'<br></p><p>Mother of three Rosemary died at her home near Malmesbury, Wiltshire, on Sunday night. She was said by family members to have been 'amazing' in her last months.<br></p><p>The cancer first struck four years ago, and at the time the couple were optimistic about treatment because it had been caught early.

So I did.'<br></p><p style=font-weight:700>As a result, he learned that he has a son, Joshua Bowler, a psychotherapist, after an affair with artists' muse Henrietta Moraes more than 54 years ago.<br></p><p style=font-weight:700>A year after the birth, he married Anne, daughter of the fifth Earl of Leicester, and they had three sons and twin daughters together.<br></p><p style=font-weight:700>From St Lucia, where he now lives, Glenconner tells me: 'When the results of the test came back, Anne was very pleased.<br></p><p style=font-weight:700>'In fact, she will probably meet up with him before I do as I am not planning on coming back to Britain.<br></p><p style=font-weight:700>'We both think it is a nice surprise&nbsp; -&nbsp; although I probably wouldn't have thought so 54 years ago.'<br></p>&nbsp;<p style=font-style:italic>Coming to a cathedral near you: Britain's unlikeliest touring theatre troupe&nbsp; -&nbsp; broadcaster Sue Lawley, her TV producer husband Hugh Williams and dashing Tory MP Hugo Swire.<br></p><p style=font-style:italic>They will perform Old Thunder: An Evening With Hilaire Belloc at St Edmundsbury Cathedral, Bury St Edmunds, in March, before taking the act to Exeter.<br></p><p style=font-style:italic>And it is not the trio's first outing.
