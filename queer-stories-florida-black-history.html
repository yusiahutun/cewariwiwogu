History</h1><div id=sub-header>June 2024 · 7 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=0 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">When we say gay in Miami, Miami Beach is uplifted as the queer capital—a paradoxical place that draws more than 170,000 people each year for the Pride Parade, but also has a deep history of anti-Blackness that persists still today.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Little is said of Miami’s historically Black neighborhoods where the LGBTQ+ community has always existed. And now, the state of Florida wants to ban Black history, queer history, and intersectionality. I want to liberate these stories.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Black history in Miami is largely silent on Black queer folks, with Miami’s LGBTQ+ history embarrassingly devoid of Black stories. Two years ago, when I embarked on my research to correct this historical vacuum by unearthing and documenting Miami’s Black queer history, Naomi Ruth Cobb was the first person who agreed to sit down and talk to me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cobb, a retired cultural anthropologist, now 69, grew up playing on the Black side of the segregation wall that separated her Liberty City neighborhood in Miami from her white neighbors down the street—the same neighbors who had furiously fought against allowing families like hers from moving in.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Being in our enclave of that part of Liberty City was safe,” says Cobb, who pulls back the neighborhood’s layers in a way that only an elder who grew up in Jim Crow Miami can really do. “Being on the other side was not safe.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If what awaited them on the other side of the wall were unspoken and spoken threats, then, Cobb says, the Black side had to be a space for safety and love—a sense of belonging and care that extended to her Black queer neighbors, although at the time, she didn’t have the language to name them as such.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“You know, I believe that I was probably one of the most fortunate people to grow up around queer love, just not knowing what it was called at the time,” Cobb, a lesbian, says. She smiles when she shares memories of the popular Black drag queens walking through the neighborhood in towering heels on their way to perform at a dance hall.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Depending on your proximity to Miami or Black people in Miami, you might only know Liberty City as the place where the Oscar-winning movie Moonlight was filmed—a rare depiction of being Black and queer in Miami. Or you may know Liberty City from JT of the homegrown City Girls, who raps, “I'm from Liberty City (I'm from the Bridge) / Nah, bitch, I ain't from South Beach.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span> I was one of the most fortunate people to grow up around queer love<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I often joke with Cobb that she’s “the original city girl.” And she agrees (though she loves JT and Yung Miami). And like JT, she ain’t from South Beach: Cobb knows Miami Beach from her youth as a place she couldn’t enjoy, because it was a racist sundown town reserved for whites only.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The history of racism faced by Black queer folks in Miami Beach runs deep. Bisexual icon Josephine Baker<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=EpuaC7E8c3YC&pg=PA141&lpg=PA141&dq=josephine+baker+Copa+City+Club+allowed+the+first+desegregated+show+%E2%80%9CI+cannot+work+where+my+people+cannot+go.+It%E2%80%99s+as+simple+as+that,%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=z-UBRuvVc0&sig=ACfU3U1gpTkOgVqtOptwX8GuyhrQ1pa35A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiKxOzvhaz9AhVtjIkEHZ7_BocQ6AF6BAgWEAM#v=onepage&q=josephine%20baker%20Copa%20City%20Club%20allowed%20the%20first%20desegregated%20show%20%E2%80%9CI%20cannot%20work%20where%20my%20people%20cannot%20go.%20It%E2%80%99s%20as%20simple%20as%20that%2C%E2%80%9D&f=false" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" famously refused to perform" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u> famously refused to perform</u></a> for a whites-only audience on Miami Beach in 1951.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I cannot work where my people cannot go. It’s as simple as that,” she told the Copa City Club manager, who eventually relented and allowed the first desegregated show at the venue.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On opening night, Baker told the integrated Miami Beach audience, “I am happy to be here and to be performing in this city under these circumstances when my people can be here to see me.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though some exceptions were made for famous Black entertainers, Miami preferred to keep everyday Black residents out of sight. In Cobb’s neighborhood, the brick segregation wall along Northwest 12th Avenue concealed the Black section of Liberty City from the white area. Remnants of that wall still stand today.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“My mom and my grandmother and my aunts—they would work with white families over in Miami Shores, and at the end of the day, they had to make sure that they were on the west side of that wall,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cobb’s family and others in the neighborhood would assign watch duties on the Black side of the wall’s entrance come nightfall; mostly, this task fell to the men. If a loved one didn’t get in on time or shortly after, it was a sign they might be in trouble.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“They said that there would be truckloads of white men on the other side of that wall waiting,” Cobb says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While there’s no denying the state-sponsored terror of growing up in Jim Crow Miami, when Cobb reflects on some of her favorite memories living behind the segregation wall, they are filled with tenderness and Black queerness.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The first time she saw two women kiss, it was at her next-door neighbor’s house party. Cobb was about 12 years old.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I didn't know what that meant,” she says. “But there was something about it that I liked seeing.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another neighbor had an ex-wife who would come visit him with her “special friend.” Her friend looked different from most of the women in the neighborhood.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“She would wear the same kind of shoes that my father had on, which were Stacy Adams tie-up shoes, and she had on a crisp white shirt and a jacket. You could tell she was a woman. But she dressed very much like my father did,” Cobb says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cobb was so excited to meet this dapper woman who also cut hair, she made a rash fashion decision to book a haircut—just to be in her presence for a little while.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then, there were the moments where her dad would clear his station wagon of his landscaping work tools to drive her and her brother for take-out barbecue across from The Pool, a community hangout spot with a dance hall and stunning performers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“They were men who dressed as women and performed at The Pool, and my father would sit out there and talk to them,” Cobb says. “Sometimes my father would get slabs of barbecue, and people would just come to the car and talk to us. That kind of love is what I saw in my neighborhood growing up.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One of those performers was also the go-to tailor and dressmaker in the Black section who designed Cobb’s 11th-grade prom dress, a long satin blue gown.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Every day, he wore lipstick and big earrings,” Cobb says, but with men’s clothes. A year later, when she returned for another dress, Cobb says she noticed that her Bahamian mom was using “she” and “her” pronouns for the tailor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“By that time, I never saw her in any more male clothes. It was just dresses,” Cobb says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lately, Florida has been in the news for the censorship of Black and queer history, thanks in large part to a governor with presidential aspirations and a talent for launching “culture-war” broadsides at anything he pejoratively deems “woke.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a recent trial, when asked to finally define woke, the governor’s lawyers said it is “the belief there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them.” Imagine that.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The most recent example of the state suppressing history it doesn’t like: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/21/us/florida-ap-african-american-studies.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Florida rejected an Advanced Placement course on African American studies, because it included topics like intersectionality and Black queer studies" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Florida rejected an Advanced Placement course on African American studies, because it included topics like intersectionality and Black queer studies</u></a>. The College Board has since removed those two topics, among others, from the lessons taught in the course.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These heightened attacks on which histories can be taught, which we’re seeing around the country and in my home state of Florida, makes sharing and preserving the stories of Black LGBTQ+ Floridians even more necessary and urgent.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1afc8257-0c6f-4f8e-9511-aea52431885f_1677190447.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Nadege Green" title="Headshot of Nadege Green" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Nadege Green is a writer and community historian based in Miami.
