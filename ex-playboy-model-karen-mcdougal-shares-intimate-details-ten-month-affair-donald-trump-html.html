(She had her implants removed in 2016 over health concerns.)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 2006, Trump, who was then the star of the reality TV show, Celebrity Apprentice, attended a pool party at the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles, hosted by Hugh Hefner for the show's contestants.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He'd been married to wife Melania less than two years at the time, and she'd just given birth to their son Barron.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Nevertheless, Karen, who was wearing a see-through dress over her swimsuit, says she caught Trump's eye.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He followed me around like a puppy dog, trying to get my attention,' she says. 'He took to me so much that the Bunny Mother (the woman charged with looking after the women working as Playboy bunnies) said: 'Wow, he really has a thing for you'.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I was saying goodbye and he was standing next to his body guard Keith Schiller (who later got a top job at the White House, before being fired) and he said, 'Keith, get her number,'.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He called a few days later and asked me to have dinner with him at the Beverly Hills Hotel,' she says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I'm ashamed about it now because I knew he was married but at the time it was out of sight, out of mind.

Keith was dispatched to pick her up but, to her surprise, she was driven to the back entrance of the famous hotel.
