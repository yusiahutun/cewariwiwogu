After martial arts classes, he and his friends would go out and pick fights so they could show off their skills - earning them a place on a police roster of local delinquents.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lee soon became as keen on girls as he was on fighting, his brother Peter recalling how - even at 15 - he'd spend a quarter of an hour in front of a mirror just getting his hair right.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But as an adolescent, Lee was painfully shy with girls but - even then - he enjoyed showing off his muscles to them. Although it may have been only a cover for his insecurity, Lee never shook off his reputation for cockiness.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 1959, aged 18, he picked a fight with the wrong victim - a teenager with powerful parents – and he moved back to San Francisco to make a fresh start.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He started to teach martial arts and, being both talented and egotistical, developed his own style which he called Jeet Kune Do, or the 'way of intercepting fist'. His own fist became particularly notorious as Lee proved his punch was so strong it could knock a man flying when delivered from just an inch away.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And nothing got him showing off his fighting moves quicker than the presence of a girl. 'If a pretty girl was anywhere near, Bruce would perk up and start a spontaneous kung fu demo,' his friend James DeMile told biographer Matthew Polly.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He would point to me and explain how fast and tough I was and then promptly knock me over and under.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lee won a place at the University of Washington where he fell in love with a stunning Japanese-American sophomore named Amy Sanbo although his chat up technique could have been disastrous - as she walked passed him to go to class one day he grabbed her forearm and squeezed with such power that her knees buckled in pain.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She shared his passion for dancing, later recalling: 'When I perform it's almost orgasmic. It is very sexual, and Bruce was like that, too. I'm horribly attracted to talent, and Bruce was a kinetic genius.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lee was drawn to the Chinese philosophy of Taoism. However, while it places a strong emphasis on reining in one's ego and vanity, Lee only had limited success in this area.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He was obsessed with achieving the perfect physique, possibly using steroids and drinking smoothies made from raw hamburger meat for maximum muscle-building protein.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lee repeatedly proposed to Sanbo but, finding him too controlling, she turned him down. He was, anyway, moving away from his Asian heritage and closer to his new American life - and, inevitably perhaps, an American wife.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Returning to visit his family in Hong Kong, Lee confessed he was walking in a bow-legged way because he'd just been circumcised, lowering his pants for the male members of the family who didn't know what he meant.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When his brother inevitably asked why, Lee replied: 'It's what they do in America. I'm American. I want to look the part.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But look the part for whom, one might have asked. He met his future wife, American Linda Emery, while studying at university and, as intimate relations between people of different races were still banned in some US states at the time, they married in secret in 1964. (Her parents were not smitten by the match although they were eventually won around).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They would have two children - Brandon (born in 1965) who accidentally died while making a film in 1993 and Shannon, born four years later.

Bruce dragged [Farrell] into her dressing room and they made love as quietly as possible, hoping no one would hear them.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'As a bachelor, Bruce liked to have affairs with beautiful, flashy girls, but he married a quiet, sensitive girl who knew how to listen and would let him have his way,' said his younger brother, Peter.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lee put it somewhat less delicately, telling a journalist in 1966: 'Linda is more Oriental than some of the Chinese I know. She is quiet, calm, and doesn't yak-yak-yak all the time.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She even didn't appear to 'yak-yak-yak' over his womanizing which inevitably increased when, after his flashy kung fu demonstrations caught the attention of TV producers, he was cast as Kato, martial arts expert and valet, in the crime-fighting TV series The Green Hornet, which went first on air in 1966.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While making the series he started a brief affair with a glamorous German-American actress, Thordis Brandt, who claimed he had 'a magnetism that was indescribable'. She went on: 'Bruce was very quiet and shy but could be very aggressive if he wanted to be. He was a show-off and always wanted to flaunt his body.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It transpired that Lee, who conveniently didn't wear a wedding ring, hadn't told his lover that he had a wife and young child.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Green Hornet introduced Lee to Hollywood stars and directors, some of whom hired him to teach them kung fu. They included Steve McQueen who, says Matt Polly, became 'like an older brother to Bruce in Hollywood' - an older brother who introduced him to drugs. Marijuana was his favorite tipple. 'He'd want to get high and have a ball, listen to music,' recalled James Coburn, another of Lee's famous clients. Lee kept a box of huge ready-rolled joints the size of his cigars in his garage.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The predatory McQueen hardly needed to introduce Lee to philandering but showed him - says Lee's biographer - how to 'cut a wide swath through the female population of actresses, groupies, production assistants, makeup artists, housewives, hitchhikers, waitresses, and hatcheck girls'.</p><img id=i-c58b16dff9eeafd9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/30/11/73733805-12349793-While_making_the_series_he_started_a_brief_affair_with_a_glamoro-a-9_1690714579222.jpg height=496 width=634 alt="While making the series he started a brief affair with a glamorous German-American actress, Thordis Brandt (above), who claimed he had 'a magnetism that was indescribable'." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>While making the series he started a brief affair with a glamorous German-American actress, Thordis Brandt (above), who claimed he had 'a magnetism that was indescribable'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lee met actress Sharon Farrell when they were making the film Marlowe together in 1968.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His wife had just given birth to their daughter Shannon but that didn't stop Lee approaching Farrell, who was in an unhappy marriage, on the MGM studio lot in Hollywood and chatting her up - and that very evening charming her into bed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He was the first man I had ever been with who had such a beautiful body,' she told Lee's biographer. 'Bruce was the most incredible lover I've ever been with. He was just so knowledgeable about a woman's body.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They continued the affair for months, Farrell recalling: 'We just were hot and heavy when we could get away. He would say, 'I'm coming over,' and he'd just show up and then he'd drag me into the bedroom.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Although she would later start an affair with McQueen and stick with him rather than Lee - who, after all, had no intention of leaving his wife - the latter was rarely out of an extra-marital affair for long.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As Lee gravitated into Hong Kong-made martial arts films in which he was the main star, he found ample opportunity for more affairs - this time dangling the prospect of stardom to aspiring actresses as an added enticement.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Gamine Taiwanese actress Betty Ting Pei met him on the set of his 1972 movie Way of the Dragon. Perhaps overwhelmed by his own importance, Lee made little attempt to hide their affair, taking her out in public and buying her a Mercedes Benz.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ever the gentleman, Lee reportedly told a friend, actress Nancy Kwan, that the affair 'doesn't mean anything….It's just a fling.
