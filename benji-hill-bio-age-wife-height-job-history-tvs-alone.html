This bio covers details related to his age, wife, job, and his career.</p><p>History TV’s season 9 of Alone premiered on 26 May 2022. The show features 10 wilderness experts/contestants and they are equipped with just 10 items of their choice. They’re left to fend for themselves, catch their own food, and avoid loneliness for as long as they can, all while filming themselves for television.</p><p>The previous eight seasons of the show were filmed in Northern Canada, Asia, and South America. In season 9, contestants are dropped into a remote wilderness valley along Labrador’s Big River. According to History’s description, Labrador is known as “the hunting ground for the predatory polar bear”.</p><p>In addition to that, there are no camera crews to film their quest because the contestants do it on their own. They are completely self-sufficient in all aspects of their survival. Survivalists must battle wildlife such as polar bears as well as the strong North Atlantic winds.</p><p>So, the last man standing who never calls out to be rescued wins half of the million dollars. The contestant who lasts the longest wins and takes home the prize of $500,000. But, nabbing that 500 grand is not an easy task which is why it is labeled “the ultimate test of human will”.</p><p>Season eight drew 18 million online streaming views in 2021, up 136 percent from season seven, which aired in the fall of 2020.</p><h3><strong>Benji Hill On History TV’s Alone</strong></h3><p>Benji Hill is among the 10 contestants who are aiming for that $500K. But he has to beat other nine survivalists namely Adam Riley, Jacques Turcotte, Jessie Krebs, Juan Pablo Quinonez, Karin Lee, Terry Burns, Tom Garstang, Igor Limansky, and Teimojin Tan.</p><p>Benji’s love for wilderness was instilled in him when a ski trip to Squaw Valley, CA was accidentally booked to Sun Valley, ID. Immediately, he fell in love with the mountain life. He and his brothers pleaded with his family to move out of the city. He was only 10 years old at the time.</p><p>Soon Benji turned into the adventure-seeking hunter that he is today. He spent his youth and mid-adulthood building his body strength. Now he is back at it again as a survivalist.</p><p>As for the ten things Benji picked, he chose a sleeping bag, bow and arrow, multitool, salt, 2-quart pot, Ferro rod, ax, paracord, trapping wire, and fishing line and hooks.</p><h3><strong>Benji Hill Job</strong></h3><p>By profession, Benji Hill is a Hunting and Packgoat Guide.</p><p>Per LinkedIn, Benji owned and worked as a trainer/coach at Sawtooth Strength and Conditioning. While attending MSU he studied Exercise and Wellness. So, he established a 19 years long career working as a health and physical fitness at the local gym. He then found his new passion for powerlifting around the same time.</p><p>This passion of his took him on a whole new <a href=#>journey</a> competing from local, to state, to national levels.</p><p>On 29 November 2003, an unknown powerlifter from Sun Valley, Idaho, named Benji Hill, walked into the Weightlifting World Championships in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. He delivered on the largest stage in weightlifting, dominating the tournament, surprising his opponents, and claiming the world title in the 225-pound weight class. In addition, he also set his personal records for deadlift—705 lbs.; squat—766 lbs.; and bench—501 lbs., on the same day.</p><p>After his legendary win, Benji walked away from powerlifting. “I was tired of all the training and eating and gym time. I wanted to get back to my roots and my love of the outdoors”.</p><p>Benji worked as a ski coach and other part-time jobs for the following 15 years while establishing himself as one of the best personal trainers in the Sun Valley area and beyond. He also began to devote a significant amount of time to exploring the mountains and wilderness areas that surrounded his hometown.</p><p>Now, Benji is <a href=#>teaching children</a> from age 8 to 15 years old about wilderness skills for survival and fun. He teaches hunting and fishing basics, building fire, finding water and food as well as tool building, wilderness safety, tracking, navigating, and having an all-around good time.</p><p><strong>Fun Fact —</strong> Benji attended The Community School, Camden, Maine, and the University of Vermont.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Benji Hill?</strong></h3><p>Born in November 1974, Benji Hill is 47 years old as of May 2022.</p><h3><strong>Benji Hill Wife</strong></h3><p>Benji Hill is married to his wife, Erin Resko Hill on 3 October 2014.
