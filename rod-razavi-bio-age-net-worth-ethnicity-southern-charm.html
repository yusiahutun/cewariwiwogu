And so they told, Rod is someone who considers himself to be a true southern gentleman and social butterfly. He is also portrayed as someone who is making friends everywhere he goes. But, most importantly, the press release mentioned him newly setting his romantic sights on Southern Charm Season 8’s newcomer <a href=#>Olivia Flowers</a>. More about this and about Rod we shall tell you in the rest of the writing.</p><h3><strong>Rod Razavi On Southern Charm</strong></h3><p>Hesitant at first, Rod Razavi finally decided to watch a few back episodes. He said he took a couple of days and watched the first episode of the last season and finally he was ready thinking “I know everyone at this party … This fits me well.”</p><p>So, like that, Rod did not mind talking about his insecurities about joining the cast. When producers asked for names to add to the cast, Rod Razavi was at the top of the list. At a Bravo event not long ago, Oliva said Rod did not have a choice as all of them just threw him. She said they were literally pushing it. Rod, meanwhile, all the time was worrying about “fitting in”.</p><p>Rod has also talked about being around the Southern Charm guys for a long time. Not a fan of conflict, Rod also opened up that he expects to be the peacemaker, rather than a source of drama in the show.</p><p>Before the show happened, Rod said, Austen was “probably” the person he knew the best. So, he was expecting it to be a “kind of interesting” dynamic to start off.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Rod Razavi’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Rod Razavi reportedly had above $2.5 Million net worth as of September 2023.</p><p>Per LinkedIn, Rod has been the director of ChemoCars since March 2017. He has had just as much fun working as the director of integrations and conversions at Zuri Group since April 2013.</p><p>Applauded in the Southern Charm show as a computer programmer, Rod’s passion and education for technology began very early. Yet, it was not until he attended Rochester Institute of Technology that he began polishing his programming skillset. He graduated from RIT with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. During his time in Rochester, he spent 3 years playing Men’s Varsity tennis and helped captain the team to a league championship his senior year. Other than tennis, Rod also loves playing soccer, supporting Cincinnati sports teams, and traveling.</p><h3><strong>Rod Razavi Age</strong></h3><p>Rod M Razavi was born in 1982. So, he reached the age of 40 in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Rod Razavi Family</strong></h3><p>Rod’s father is Ali Razavi. He can be found on Instagram <a href=#>@ali_razavisar1</a>. As per LinkedIn, he has been a cardiologist at Trihealth Heart Institute in Cincinnati, Ohio since July 1979. He also is known to be affiliated with Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati.</p><p>Rod’s mother is Guity Razavi. She can be found on IG @guityrazavi. On her FB, she mentions studying at Nemazee School Of Nursing from 1965 to 1968, and on her LinkedIn, she just described herself as a homemaker.</p><p>Both Rod’s parents were most likely still together and married as of September 2023.</p><p>Further, in his family, Rod has a brother and a sister.</p><p>His sister is Susan Razavi Abouhassan of Columbus, Ohio. She turned 46 in January 2023. Following in her dad’s footsteps, Susan received her medical degree from Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine. She is now practicing as an allergist-immunologist in Columbus. Also, Susan is married to her fellow university sweetheart&nbsp;William A Abouhassan, a plastic surgeon in Columbus, Ohio.</p><p>Bobak Razavi, Rod’s brother, on the other hand, did not pursue a career in medicine but in Law. He went to the University of Wisconsin Law School for a J.D. in Law. On LinkedIn, Bobak also presents himself as a global issues and American history teacher at SPA and founder and director at Film & Frolic Moviemaking Camp. Bobak also has been married to Kate Sorensen Razavi, an experienced litigator and trial attorney.</p><h3><strong>What Is Rod Razavi’s Ethnicity?</strong></h3><p>Rod Razavi’s ethnicity is Persian, Iranian-American to be precise.</p><h3><strong>Rod Razavi Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>On Southern Charm, Rod Razavi is introduced as a “staple” in the Charleston social scene and a quintessential Southern gent who has “swept” <a href=#>Olivia</a> off her feet, regardless of who that might upset.</p><p>On Olivia’s official BravoTV.com bio, it’s been cited that she put Austen in the rearview as she explores the dating scene in Charleston with a new man. (Rod of course!) Plus, in the trailer of the season, Rod and she can be seen sharing a kiss. In another scene, Rod is shown having a conversation with Austen in which he confesses, “I’ve been out with Olivia.”</p><p>At this point, it was not understood what became of them.</p><p>What Rod has talked about though is that the first time he was on camera was on a date with Olivia. And everything that followed after that, he found it to be complicated, especially when Olivia’s ex-boyfriend was still part of their friend group.</p><h3><strong>Rod Razavi Height</strong></h3><p>Rod Razavi stands below 5’11” in height.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Rod Razavi From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Rod Razavi originally hails from&nbsp;Cincinnati, Ohio.
