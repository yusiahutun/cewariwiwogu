for £1,980,000 after today’s tense 10-minute auction which the auctioneer said was ‘no price for this house’.</span><br></p><p><span>Amy’s family asked auctioneers not to promote the sale by revealing who had lived there.</span><br></p><p><span>They are also thought to have vetted potential buyers beforehand to ensure there were no time wasters.</span><br></p><p><span>The house is still surrounded by tributes 15 months after the 27-year-old died from alcohol poisoning.</span><br></p><p><span>It is thought would-be buyers were put off by the constant stream of fans and tourists gathering outside.</span><br></p><p><span>After the Rehab star’s death last summer there were plans to transform the property into the headquarters for the Amy Winehouse Foundation charity set up in her name, but this was shelved due to fears there would be constant attention from fans.</span><br></p><p><span>Amy was found dead in her flat by her live-in security guard on July 23 last year.</span><br></p><p><span>An inquest heard bottles of vodka were found in her bedroom and she had five times the legal drink-drive limit of alcohol in her blood.</span><br></p><p><span>But the troubled star, who battled drug addiction, was found to have no illegal substances in her body at the time she died and a coroner recorded a verdict of death by misadventure.</span><br></p><p><span>Since her death the five-times Grammy winner has gone on to become the bestselling artist of the 21st century with her 2006 album Back to
