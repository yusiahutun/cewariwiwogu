Some friends want to do all they can, so we may stop crying. You’re none of these. You go the extra mile to put a smile on my face. Thank you for being such a fantastic friend.</li><li>There is so much I want to tell you about your gift! The first thing was how excited I felt when I opened the box. It was wrapped beautifully, and the note on top said, “Open Me First”. As I opened the card, I read a sweet message. Then, holding the velvety present in my hands, I felt so happy. A little box fell out as I lifted the wrapping paper! Inside was a bracelet with a beautiful charm symbolising our friendship: a tree.</li><li>As I made friends, I sought someone who loved the things I loved. Someone who would love my hobbies so that we could always be together. You came into my life being so different from me that I thought we wouldn’t click, but you taught me that friendship is not about being similar but respecting our differences and embracing variety. Thank you so much.</li><li>Meeting you brought me into a world I might not have been exposed to if I had not met you. A better me emerges from the former me because you came into my life. Thank you, friend.</li><li>Thank you for being brave and following your big dreams. It saddens me that I won’t be at your side as you take on this new endeavour, but rest assured that I am always here to support you when you need it. I am proud of who you are and the woman you have become. Remember how much I love you.</li><li>I thought about our imminent death in the cold trailer with my kids every night. I never thought about a stranger coming to our rescue. Thank you for saving our lives and seeking me to be your friend when no one else cared.</li><li>What could I have done without you on those days and nights when I thought my life was over and tears couldn’t dry from my eyes? You stood by my side and told me all those stupid jokes. You didn’t leave my side even when I said I didn’t want to see anyone. Thank you so much, my buddy.
