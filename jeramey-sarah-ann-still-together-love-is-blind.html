The answer is yes. Jeramey Lutinski and Sarah Ann met in The Pods on Love Is Blind Season 6, but didn’t get engaged. Jeramey broke up with Sarah Ann in The Pods before he proposed to his fiance, Laura Dadisman. Jeramey and Laura dated for a few weeks before their breakup in Episode 10 due to Jeramey’s continued communication with Sarah Ann, who contacted him on social media after they left The Pods. The next episode saw Jeramey and Sarah Ann get back together at a party with the cast.</p><p>“I don’t regret talking to you. I do not regret that at all. I’ve said that multiple times in front of other people—to Laura. All of that to say, I made the wrong decision and I think you know that at this point. I had every indication in front of me that you and I should’ve done this together. Every feeling, things that we talked about, my emotions toward it,” Jeramey told Sarah Ann, who responded, “This would’ve played out so differently.” The episode continued with Jeramey and Sarah Ann riding jet skis at the party while Laura cried with other cast members about the end of her relationship with Jeramey.</p><p>So… are Jeramey and Sarah Ann still together from Love Is Blind Season 6? The answer is yes. Jeramey and Sarah Ann confirmed they were still together at the Love Is Blind Season 6 reunion. After the reunion, Sarah Ann defended herself amid claims she wasn’t a “girl’s girl” for messaging Jeramey while he was still engaged to Laura. “I definitely heard her out… with the experiment, it’s such a high pressure situation and everybody’s dating everybody, and so her experience with Jeramey was completely different than mine,” Sarah Ann said. “But I did take [that] into consideration… I felt in that moment that she was being genuine about the way that she felt, however, upon getting to know Jeramey and based off the connection that we built together, I realized quickly that they just weren’t compatible.”</p><p>She continued, “So while her perception of him was terrible human and whatever, I don’t think that that’s what she said, but… I felt that I needed to make that decision for myself. And ultimately I feel that I made the right decision, and I stand by that, I will continue to stand by that.”</p><p>At the time of writing this, neither Jeramey nor Sarah Ann follow each other on Instagram. Both Jeramey and Sarah Ann also don’t follow Laura, and she doesn’t follow them. Jermey seemed to nod at his and Sarah Ann’s jet ski scene in Love Is Blind in an <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvSxEIYImQO/?hl=en">Instagram</a> video in July 2023, around the same time Season 6 would’ve filmed, of him drinking a Truly on a jet ski. “Trulys and jet skis,” he captioned the video, which included what seemed like a woman’s voice at the end. Jeramey also posted another <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtVSJr7samL/?hl=en">Instagram</a> photo of him in a jet ski in June 2023. “Mustaches, Jetskis and Big Glasses,” he captioned the post of him in Lake Norman, North Carolina.</p><p>In January 2024, two weeks before the premiere of Love Is Blind Season 6, Jeramey share a cryptic <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2xgzGHOZl0/?hl=en" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> video about a current struggle in his life. “I don’t ever go on social media to talk about personal stuff or anything like that because we all know people who do that, and it’s just not great. For what I’m experiencing right now, I feel like this is something a lot of people go through and it might be discouraging,” he said. “I’m not going to claim to have any sort of expertise in this, but it’s just worth a share at this point. I feel like I’m experiencing the true definition of the law of opposites right now.”</p><p>He captioned the video, “This is long but promise it’s worth a listen. Sometimes life can be crazy, and that’s ok. Just know how to push through it 🫶🏻”</p><p>Sarah Ann, for her part, also shared a cryptic <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz4SR4HpzeV/?hl=en&img_index=1" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> post about what she’s learned in the past three decades of her life in a photo for her 30th birthday in November 2023. “A blessing to have made it this far. I had a firm, white knuckle grasp on my 20s & closing that chapter feels bittersweet,” she captioned the post. “I celebrated this birthday with a fresh mindset which required some self reflection. Here’s what I know; I feel more confident than I ever have & I accept all of who I am. The curves I spent majority of my life hating, are my favorite of my physical features. I find that I am no longer able to enjoy long drinking adventures, in fact, I’m less interested & value my REM sleep.”</p><p>She contiued, “However, I feel obliged to let you all know that I can ‘still hang’ Losing weight is much more difficult but the continued effort to maintain a healthy heart, lungs, and brain is far more important. Botox is a good friend. We love her. Family & friends are a blessing. Time spent is the most precious. Travel makes you richer. Good food & good conversation are two of my favorite things. Work hard to play harder & invest. True love, if you’re lucky enough to find it, is a magical feeling. Peace is a practice. Glory to God for I am blessed. Thank you for the birthday wishes.”</p><p>Jeramy addressed the claims in an <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/C3raemqsiX4/ rel=nofollow>Instagram post.</a> “Just for some clarity. 1) My previous engagement was not a secret while filming. It was well documented, well known. 2) I was not living with anyone when casting reached out,” he said in the caption, in part.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfn7KzrcyesGarkaeuqXnAp6Vmq6Seua1506ienqyYmr9uuM6vnGaho2KvrbXNnWY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./471232-chris-rocks-family-wife-girlfriend-children-parents-siblings.html>&#171;&nbsp;Chris Rock's family: ex-wife, girlfriend, children, parents, siblings</a>
