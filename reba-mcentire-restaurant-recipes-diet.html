She shared the news during a recent concert in Oklahoma on Friday evening, where she was joined by Chief Gary Batton of Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. She said, <strong>“We’re thrilled to be pieced because it’s going to be right downtown Atoka. It’s going to be called Reba’s Place, and it’s going to be in the old Masonic building, y’all know where that is if you’ve been to Akota.”</strong></span></p><p><span>She continued to share that they’re very excited about it and said,<strong> “It’s going to have great food, family atmosphere, a bandstand in there where we can do a little pickin’ and grinnin’ and singing, and we’re hoping by the end of next year, around September 2022 around that sometimes that we’ll be ready for serving you guys. Come up and see us!”</strong></span></p><p><span>According to the establishment’s official website, her restaurant will have two stories of dining space that open to a central stage which will regularly host live music performances, and the menu will include dishes that are most popular in the region alongside favorites from other areas, including Nashville, New Orleans, and Mexico. For extra information, the menu highlights include ‘Fancy’ steak dinner named after Reba’s song, and along with that, the menu includes street tacos, chicken fried steak, and her personal favorite, pinto beans and cornbread.</span></p><p><span>About the interior, the main floor will showcase a restored antique bar that is more than 100 years old and offers a broad range of beer, wine, and spirits crafted into signature cocktails. According to the official website, the aesthetics of the venue are heavily influenced by Reba’s western heritage.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, the retail space will feature a combination of merchandise created just for this new venture alongside Reba’s favorites. The restaurant will also showcase a curated collection of memorabilia from Reba’s personal archives changed regularly, and the exact location is at 319 East Court St, Atoka, OK 74525.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Reba McEntire&nbsp;Recipes, Diet & Workouts Details</span></strong></h2><p><span><span>Reba McEntire</span> has always shared her love for healthy food and its recipes with her fans.

She shared the recipe of Praline Sweet Potato Casserole, which is down-home comfort food and super easy to make.</span></p><p><span>She shared the recipe for 6 serves and the ingredients include 40 ounces can sweet potatoes, drained, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, 2 tablespoon margarine, melted, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon salt, 2 large eggs with toppings of ¾ cup brown sugar, ¼ cup beans, chopped. 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour and 2 tablespoons margarine, melted.</span></p><p><span>The instructions are;</span></p><p><span>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

She suggests cutting down on red meats and fats and instead opting for chicken, salads, and fish. She says not to stress about the weight fluctuations and exercise regularly. She also said that she enjoys fresh juice for her breakfast instead of waffles and peanut butter. At last, the singer suggests having fun with your friends and family saying, <strong>“there are things you can tell a friend that you can’t tell anyone else. It’s kind of like a therapy session.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The Fancy singer has shared that she stays away from sugar as much as she can and said, <strong>“I eat fruits and vegetables. I love salmon for my omega-3s…take supplements. I try to drink coconut water, which I love, and aloe vera juice.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The 64-year-old country music singer has always taken care of her body and her health which benefitted her to not feel and look old. She said, <strong>“I feel 35, maybe 40. Used to be 60 years and one foot was in the grave. Now, maybe 85 is one foot, maybe 95, my momma’s 92. She still drives herself. She lives by herself. She’s spunky, and she’s frisky.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The singer has shared how she was able to drop 10 pounds in a week by getting off bread and fried foods, and now it just doesn’t work. She has a career of 40 years and is regarded as the queen of country music, but she feels kind of funny being in the same company as the queens she grew up with like Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Kitty Wells, Tammy Wynette and said,<strong> “ it’s kind of like when you were in the first grade and the seniors that year are always the seniors. It’s like what Grath said one time: ‘I might not deserve it, but I’m not giving it back. It’s just that to me, they will always be the queens.”</strong></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunC4yJ%2BcraeUlsZwvsSbmGalk5q7tbXRnmSrnaOprra%2BwKerZqqVmLaxsdJmm6KdpA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./fashion-quotes-203026.html>&#171;&nbsp;101 Fashion Quotes So Timeless They're Basically Iconic</a>
