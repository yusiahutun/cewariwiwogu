Growing up, my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents said she couldn’t play with us because we were Black. [...] I’m going to now direct this at Vice President Biden. I do not believe you are a racist. I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground. I also believe it’s personal. It was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. It was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing. There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools.

I would strengthen it. I would include ballistic missile testing. I think that we can strengthen what we do in terms of monitoring and verification, of progress. But there's no question that a lot of negotiation with a great deal of depth took place over a long period of time to reach that agreement, and it was it was an agreement that was being complied with by all parties." —<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-sen-kamala-harris-on-face-the-nation-june-23-2019/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Interview with CBS News" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Interview with CBS News</a> | June 23, 2019</p><h2 data-node-id=43 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On Patriotism …</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"A patriot is not someone who condones the conduct of our country whatever it does.

Six years ago, in fact, we had a different health crisis. It was called Ebola. And we all remember that pandemic, but you know what happened then? Barack Obama and Joe Biden did their job. Only two people in the United States died. Two. That is what's called leadership. But compare that to the moment we find ourselves in now. When other countries are following the science, Trump pushed miracle cures he saw on Fox News. While other countries were flattening the curve, he said, the virus would just–poof–go away. Like a miracle.</p><p>"So when other countries opened back up for business, what did we do? We had to shut down again. This virus has impacted almost every country, but there's a reason it has hit America worse than any other advanced nation. It's because of Trump's failure to take it seriously from the start, his refusal to get testing up and running, his flip-flopping on social distancing and wearing masks, his delusional belief that he knows better than the experts. All of that is the reason that an American dies of COVID-19 every 80 seconds. It's why countless businesses have had to shut their doors for good. It's why there is complete chaos over when and how to reopen our schools. Mothers and fathers are confused and uncertain and angry about childcare and the safety of their kids at school. Whether they'll be in danger if they go, or fall behind if they don't." —<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a33587468/kamala-harris-first-speech-vp-nominee-delaware/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="First Address as Democratic VP Nominee" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">First Address as Democratic VP Nominee</a> | August 12, 2020</p><h2 data-node-id=49 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On Voting …<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Here's the thing.
