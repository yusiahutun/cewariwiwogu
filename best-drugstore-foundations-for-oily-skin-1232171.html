Fret not, get the perfect makeup look on that oily skin of yours, that too, without breaking the bank. Be prepared to have that air-brushed finish of your dreams with the best drugstore foundations for oily skin.&nbsp;</p><p>A good foundation base determines a good makeup finish. But oily skin is not easy to work with. You need to use the right products under the foundation to get that flawless base. Shedding some more information about the products to be used under foundation, our contributor Maya Adivi, who is a certified makeup artist, says, “I think it's very important to wear sunscreen under foundation if you're going out in the daytime. Other products you may want to use include moisturizer, which will help hydrate the skin and smooth down dead skin cells for more even application. A primer for oily skin will help improve foundation longevity while keeping the skin at.”&nbsp;</p><p>For once you want your foundation to lock in without a greasy film forming on top and you frantically searching for blotting sheets. Opting for high-quality foundations, specifically made for oily skin, can give you your desired base layer, and the cherry-on-top, you can find most of them at your nearest drugstore. The drugstore brands possess some high-performing foundations that provide you with the smoothest and lightest canvas for your makeup. They are super-charged with skin-caring ingredients and are cruelty-free, alcohol-free, fragrance-free, and preservative-free.&nbsp; Drawing from our experience, here is a curated list of 14 drugstore foundations for oily skin.</p><p>Our top picks</p><p><h2 class=title>How We Determined the Best Drugstore Foundations for Oily Skin?</h2></p><p>While on our hunt for the best drugstore foundations for oily skin, we looked for formulas infused with skin-loving and oil-absorbing ingredients, including salicylic acid, along with high-performing makeup pigments. We also searched for words like “matte” and “shine-free” while looking for oil-free formulas that can make your skin greasy in the long run. To note, oily skin tends to produce excess sebum and the pores easily get clogged, resulting in acne, dark spots, and breakouts. It becomes very hard for oily skin to control the film of sheen that seeps through the makeup and forms on top, melting away everything. Using oil-blotting sheets carries the danger of the makeup getting wiped away while layering with powder results in caking and creasing. We have picked out some of the best oil-free drugstore foundations that do not sit heavy on the skin and deliver an airbrush effect without clogging the pores. They are specifically made for oily and acne-prone skin with non-comedogenic formulas and mattified finishes. Boasting of lasting round-the-clock without transferring or smudging or melting, these foundations have a wide array of shades and are extremely cost-effective.</p><p><h2 class=title>15 Best Drugstore Foundations for Oily Skin</h2></p><p>The reason why Maybelline Fit Me Foundation has bagged the top position is that it checks all the boxes - non-comedogenic, oil-free, blurs pores, and stops shine. The best part, it is from a well-known brand, has over 40 shades, and is insanely affordable. Adding to that, it contains micro-powders that absorb excess oil and prolong the wear of your makeup. Plus, it provides medium coverage and is dermatologist and allergy-tested. Apply with fingers, a foundation brush, or a sponge, and it will refine your pores to give you a matte look that will last all day.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Skin type: </strong>Normal to oily&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Finish: </strong>Natural</p><p>Pros</p><ul class=pros_list><li>Suitable for normal to oily skin</li><li>Medium coverage</li><li>Liquid foundation</li><li>Lightweight</li><li>Natural, seamless finish</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul class=cons_list><li>Not long-wearing</li></ul><li class="product_info_li border_bottom" readability=-0.64705882352941><p>2</p><p>Best shade options</p><a href=# rel=sponsored title="e.l.f.

The pointers mentioned below might be able to help you in doing so:</p><ul><li><strong>Formulation: </strong>Foundations for oily skin should be oil-free. A formulation that is shine-controlling and gives off a matte finish is ideal.</li><li><strong>Non-comedogenic: </strong>Oily skin tends to suffer from clogged pores due to the production of excess sebum. Always look for non-comedogenic formulas that do not clog pores with dirt or excess oil.</li><li><strong>Coverage: </strong>Foundations with lightweight coverage that allows the skin to breathe is suitable for oily skin. As the facial skin remains covered in makeup, it is essential to use products that let the skin breathe.</li><li><strong>Customer Reviews: </strong>Last but not least, customer reviews can be your unexpected guide while choosing the right foundation for oily skin. The reviews will let you know how well a foundation performs regarding oily skin and its accompanying complications.</li></ul><p><h2 class=title>How to Use Drugstore Foundations for Oily Skin?</h2></p><p>When you have oily skin, prepping up your skin before applying foundation is as important as finding the right foundation. Follow the steps mentioned below to lock in your foundation for a flawless makeup finish:</p><p><strong>Cleanser</strong>: A clean base is essential for the foundation to set properly. Cleansing will remove all the dirt, oil, and impurities, leaving behind clear, hydrated skin. Select a cleanser for oily skin and with a cotton pad, gently clean your face and neck.</p><p><strong>Moisturizer</strong>: Moisturizing provides the required hydration to oily skin. Select an oil-free and non-comedogenic formula with hyaluronic acid as it reduces the appearance of pores, hydrating and plumping up the skin.</p><p><strong>Primer</strong>: Our contributor Maya Adivi, a certified makeup artist, shares, “You can use a primer without foundation, even if you have oily skin! Using a primer alone can help blur the look of the pores and provide some oil-control, but without the heaviness or need for blending that can come with foundation.”</p><p>Primer is necessary to control shine and make sure the makeup stays for a longer period. Choose a matte primer and prime your face, including the lips and eyelids.</p><p><strong>Powder</strong>: Dust a light layer of loose powder on the T-zone before applying the foundation. It will lock in makeup and prevent oiliness.</p><p><strong>Foundation</strong>: Select a foundation with a mattifying and long-wearing formula designed to prevent shine. Avoid foundations that claim to be dewy or luminous. A matte finish powder foundation is best for oily skin. Take a foundation brush or a blending sponge and lightly cover your face and neck with the foundation. Build a light coverage without looking cakey. Finish with a layer of pressed powder when using a liquid foundation for it to set correctly. You are ready to apply the rest of your makeup products.</p><p><strong>Contributor:&nbsp;</strong>Maya Adivi, Certified Makeup artist, <a href=#>Click here for blog</a></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Our findings show that the best drugstore foundations for oily skin perform at par with their expensive counterparts.
