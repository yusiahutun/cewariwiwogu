Like him, many couldn’t wait for him to prove himself in the league after his impressive high school career, in which a handful of universities wanted him on their college teams. While it would be outrageous to claim that the quarterback has had an unremarkable professional career to date, it is fair to say that his performance has been average since he was selected by the Miami Dolphins. In this post, we will spare you this possible embarrassment by providing you with adequate information about Ryan Tannehill’s Wife.</p><p>No wonder the Fins’ head coach insisted that he was relevant enough to remain the team’s quarterback. Adam Gase made the announcement recently (in March 2008) despite the fact that the team had managed well without Ryan and Jay Cutler’s place in the squad after his anterior cruciate ligament injury and repair operation that kept him off the field for the entire 2017 season.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Bradley Chubb Biography, Career Stats, Height, Weight, Age, and Other Facts</a></strong></p><p>Of course, there is something about Ryan that the coach considers crucial for his team, but people like Miko Grimes, wife of the Dolphins’ ex-cornerback, Brent Grimes, would not necessarily want to believe that Mr. Tannehill offers the Dolphins unique added value. In case you missed it: Lady Grimes had a blast whipping Ryan on Twitter sometime in 2015 after the team did so poorly. She tweeted that Ryan “stank” and wondered how many people the quarterback would get fired before management realized he was the team’s problem.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ryan-Tannehill.jpg><p>You don’t have to form an opinion about what caliber player Ryan is, because whatever Miko has to say about the man, his actions speak for themselves. While he finished his first season with The Killer Bees Defense with new team records for newcomers in terms of accuracy of fit and finishes, his performance in the 2013 season game against the New England Patriots was super-dumb. With 3 touchdowns he scored 312 yards, had no interceptions, and was fired four times.</p><p>He kept pace with his good performance in the 2014 season, which earned him a 6-year contract extension worth $96 million; that was in May 2015. Ryan proved that he was worth the deal this season when he scored 12 interceptions, 24 touchdowns, and 4,208 passing yards. The 2016 season arrived and he set a record in his career: 67.1 wins percentage, 12 interceptions with 19 touchdowns, and 2,995 yards.</p><p>His franchise records with The Fins include the most consecutive passes in 2015, and at 25, this record is also the NFL’s annual record. From 2012 to 2016, Ryan Tannehill had the highest pass rate with 62.2%. In 2014, he was the player on the team with the most pass completions and the highest completion rate in a single season, with 392 and 66.4% respectively.</p><p>That’s not all, he set a 48-yard record in 2013, becoming the longest rush of any quarterback. This happened after he reached 31 yards, the longest rush of a quarterback for newcomers the previous year (2012). This year he also broke other team records for most passing attempts, most passing yards, and most passing finishes in a rookie season. Accordingly, he beat previous records, reaching 484, 3,294, and 282.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Ryan Tannehill’s Wife?</strong></h2><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ryan-Tannehill-and-Family.jpg decoding=async alt="Who Is Ryan Tannehill’s Wife, Here Are Facts You Need To Know" width=650 height=470 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As far as you can tell, Ryan Tannehill’s love life revolves around his wife Lauren Tannehill, whom he married in January 2012 after two years of courting. Although details of how they met and became lovers are left to the imagination of those who were fascinated by their affair, it is said that the two met in Florida in 2009.</p><p>Although it was difficult to learn one or two things about Lauren, as her life was somewhat overshadowed by her husband’s career, we can say that her marriage to Ryan has so far produced a son whom they called Steel Ryan Tannehill. Not long ago (May 2018) Lauren announced through Instagram that she and Ryan were expecting their second child.</p><p>According to the quarterback, Lauren has been a good and supportive wife. He expressed that a large part of his inspiration to stay strong and get through hard times comes from her. The man and his wife are especially pleased that he was able to keep his emotions in check throughout the 2017 season, during which he fought against injuries in the ACL.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Eric Berry Biography, Contract, Stats, What Kind Of Cancer Did He Suffer From</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Facts You Need To Know</strong></h2><p>1.
