Not only along the trail's edge but in glades between the trees. If I am painting a deciduous forest, the canopy is so thin that all the trunks' shadows show through the thin canopy, which I will illustrate as many long single lines. Second, the base paint for the conifer trees is painted with a short up and down continuous stroke forming a texture of triangular shapes. I paint with a water-soluble medium, so the third step is to re-wet this texture, which will allow the paint to flow just a bit and the lighter tint will appear.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Fourth, the highlights of white snow are added.
