If only losing weight were so easy! What’s stumping us? Turns out, we simply don’t process food the way we used to when we were younger, a glitch that burdens us with low energy, digestive woes, blood-sugar problems, and pounds that seem impossible to shed. Luckily, there’s something that may help: SpiceFruit.</p><p>Finding ways to improve our metabolism is important; Researchers estimate that nearly all women over the age of 45 struggle with a slower metabolism. In fact, more and <a href=# rel=noopener>more Americans are being diagnosed</a> with <a href=#>metabolic syndrome</a>, a cluster of symptoms including high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and excess belly fat that develops when our metabolism can’t keep up with the blood sugar – spiking foods of the standard American diet.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Super Fruit That May Help</h2><p>While doctors catch serious cases of metabolic syndrome — like those that develop into diabetes — many more go undetected, so women are left blaming themselves. What’s more, nutrition expert <a href=# rel=noopener>Fred Pescatore</a>, MD, says, “95 percent of women have a subclinical metabolic glitch, meaning conventional medicine has nothing to offer them or the knowledge to diagnose or care for them.”</p><p>So, when wellness expert <a href=# rel=noopener>Naomi Whittel</a> heard about a West African super fruit that may naturally mend a broken metabolism and burn belly fat, she was intrigued. The author of Glow15 (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $19.74</a>) says, “When COVID began, I kept thinking, ‘How can we become the strongest versions of ourselves?’ The answer is focusing on strengthening our metabolism, which is a whole-body issue.” That’s because when a metabolism is working properly, it ensures optimal immunity, cholesterol, blood pressure, and <a href=#>blood-sugar levels</a>. Even better, stuck-on pounds may finally fall off.</p><p>Determined to learn more about this powerful plant called <a href=# rel=noopener>Dichrostachys glomerata</a> (DG), Whittel traveled to Cameroon, a West African nation with virtually no obesity or metabolic syndrome, to meet with researchers. There, she reviewed findings from two “gold standard” studies that found DG — which Whittel calls SpiceFruit — works like a “multivitamin for the metabolism.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Proof that SpiceFruit May Speed Slimming</h2><p>In an <a href=# rel=noopener>eight-week study</a>, when overweight folks with metabolic syndrome started taking DG before lunch and dinner each day, those who took the extract lost 2,400 percent more weight than those who didn’t. They also melted eight times more inches off of their waistline. In a <a href=# rel=noopener>separate study</a>, healthy people who took DG before their largest meal of the day dropped 14 pounds and lowered their body fat percentage by over five percent without even trying!</p><p>Keep in mind that there is some conflicting research. Another study published in the <a href=# rel=noopener>Journal of Dietary Supplements</a> found that DG didn’t significantly effect weight loss in participants who didn’t alter their diet with healthy options or increase their physical activity. Still, some of the news about DG is promising.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What might make SpiceFruit so effective?</h2><p>DG brims with plant compounds and antioxidants that work like tiny mechanics repairing our metabolism, as Dr. Pescatore explains. He also says, “It boosts the hormone adiponectin by 22 percent, which helps maximize muscles’ ability to convert carbs into energy.” And when a mended metabolism returns to burning carbs, you can enjoy your holiday faves and still slim. Pescatore claims that he often sees patients melt three belly inches in seven days.</p><p>“I’ve never seen such impressive results from a natural ingredient,” says Whittel, who recently brought SpiceFruit stateside in the form of a gummy-style “vitamin” called GloSlim (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from the Vitamin Shoppe, $39.99</a> for a one-month supply). Just one gummy per day, with candy-like blackberry and spiced-orange flavor, delivers 300 milligrams (mg) of this powerful plant.</p><p>And the benefits don’t stop with weight loss. Within a week, many women report more energy and fewer cravings. And <a href=# rel=noopener>Julius Oben</a>, PhD, the world’s leading expert on the plant, says it lowers blood pressure by up to 24 points and “bad” cholesterol by 75 points. “SpiceFruit significantly reduces oxidative stress, which is what makes it so powerful,” he says.</p><p>Ready to experience these easy results yourself? Keep reading!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ready, Set, Slim!</h2><p>To experience the study-backed slimming and wellness results, just treat yourself to one GloSlim SpiceFruit gummy a day with food. It’s that simple! That’s right — eating your favorite holiday fare, like a slice of pecan pie, may not derail your efforts, thanks to SpiceFruit’s amazing powers.</p><p>Tara Parker, 50, of Belmont, Massachusetts, used SpiceFruit to help her shed 73 pounds — including the ones she gained during quarantine. “The gummies tasted awesome and were so easy — they became part of my morning routine.” She noticed, “The pounds and inches were dropping, even when I was on vacation!”</p><p>And grandmother Valerie Daniel dropped 30 pounds using GloSlim SpiceFruit. “Despite the pandemic and long winters and getting older, I have a waistline again for the first time in years,” she cheers. “I’m an anomaly among my postmenopausal friends. They say, ‘How do you keep looking younger? What’s your secret?’ And it has to be the SpiceFruit. That’s the only difference. I didn’t have to do anything else.”</p><p>To amplify SpiceFruit’s results even more, try the below healthy <a href=#>metabolism-rebooting strategies</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1: Enjoy clean foods.</h2><p>“For a humming metabolism this time of year, I try to eat 2,000 calories daily,” says Whittel, “with the majority of the calories coming from good fats, plus plenty of fiber and adequate protein, while keeping sugar low and carbs below 50 grams if possible.” In addition, she recommends limiting processed foods. Whittel contends that by ridding your body of unnecessary processed chemicals and toxins that strain the metabolism, your system can better speed-heal itself. That means you can soar into the new year eating clean, energizing foods like lean meats and fish, vegetables, low-sugar fruits such as berries, and lots of healthy fats like avocados, nuts, and seeds.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2: Wake up with water.</h2><p>Whittel’s favorite, easy way to optimize the results of SpiceFruit is through hydration. “We often get caught up in how many glasses of water we are drinking, but a better indicator is counting the amount of times we are urinating.” Whittel’s advice: Drink a glass of water as soon as you wake up, then aim to drink enough so that you’re visiting the bathroom at least six times per day. She says, “Your metabolism will thank you.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3: Fidget-size.</h2><p>Whittel loves boosting her metabolism with a stealthy way to sneak in exercise: twitching<br>or fidgeting. Science has shown that making even the smallest movements while you’re on the go or even sitting down can boost metabolic function.</p><p>Whittel shares, “I love to keep moving throughout the day by doing simple motions like shaking my wrists, tapping my toes at my desk or moving my feet or legs when I’m standing in line. These movements are fantastic at optimizing the metabolism and revving results of SpiceFruit!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bonus: SpiceFruit may reduce allover pain by 80 percent.</h2><p>Good news: Folks with an achy back or knees can say so long to joint pain! Research focused on the African spice extract DG suggests that the slimming ingredient also delivers pain relief. In an animal study published in the <a href=# rel=noopener>Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology Advances</a>, subjects with joint pain experienced significant relief when given the extract. Pain was cut by 80 percent and swelling also dropped. Experts hope DG may offer a drug-free option to ease chronic pain, thanks to its anti-inflammatory powers. Pescatore, who recommends the extract for weight management, feels encouraged by his patients reporting pain relief, noting, “DG is certainly one of the most intriguing natural supplements I’ve come across recently!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Sample Day (While Taking Spice Fruit) to Get You Started</h2><p><strong>Breakfast: Pizza Omelet “Muffins</strong>“</p><p>Instructions: Mix 6 eggs, 6 egg whites, 1 diced tomato, 1⁄2 cup of chopped basil, and 1 teaspoon of dried oregano. Pour the mixture into 12 muffin tins and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit until set.
