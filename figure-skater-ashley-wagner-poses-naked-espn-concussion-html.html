'When I was coming up in skating, the thought was you fell, you hit your head, dust yourself off, get up and try it again.

'A lot of times in figure skating, whiplash is what gives you a concussion more than anything else. You don't even have to hit your head on the ice to get a concussion, so having that neck strength has helped a lot in that aspect of my life,' Wagner explains.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'In the past, openly admitting ''Hey, I've had a lot of concussions, I'm having balance issues, my memory is not the same; I still want to go to the Olympics, so try not to take that into consideration!'' You just didn't do that.
