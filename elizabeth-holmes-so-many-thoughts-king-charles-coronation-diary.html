It was surreal to be in this moment, on this day. As someone who has written about the royal family for years, on <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Instagram</a>, in my <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">newsletter&nbsp;</a>as well as <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">a New York Times best-selling book</a> on their influential style, I had always had the coronation in the back of my mind. What would it feel like to witness this ancient ritual, to see a crown put on the head of a king? When <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>HELLO! invited me to join their team&nbsp;</a>for this major moment in royal history, the first in seven decades and only the 40th ever, I said yes enthusiastically.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f07a2be01069-coronationday-24.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0b6a47ae67bf-coronationday-9.jpg><p id=eMpdamC420 data-wc=102>On the morning of Saturday, May 6, I awoke before dawn and made my way to the procession route. Stepping out of my hotel in Mayfair, just a few blocks away from the Mall, it was eerily quiet. The streets were blocked off and clusters of crowd control crews in neon vests stood on each corner, with nary a crowd to control. Reports in the weeks preceding suggested apathy among Brits toward the new sovereign and even some anger over his expensive crowning in the midst of a cost of living crisis. Was this stillness a sign of those polls playing out?</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Coronation concert best photos: Princess Charlotte curtsies, King Charles dances and more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3dded6fba480-coronation-concert-windsor-kate-middleton-crowd.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Coronation concert best photos: Princess Charlotte curtsies, King Charles dances and more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Coronation concert best photos: Princess Charlotte curtsies, King Charles dances and more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eyTmuABAxci data-wc=21>As I neared the procession route, the mood changed markedly and the story changed entirely. The buzz built with each block.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7QYL7dt6j data-wc=46>By the time I reached Trafalgar Square, there were so many people it was nearly impossible to weave through the crowds.

The narrow sidewalk in front was already three rows deep with people who had been waiting for hours along the maze of barricades. Up in the top-floor dwelling, with windows that opened wide to offer a birds-eye view, I changed into the dress I bought specifically for the day by Self Portrait (a British brand worn often by the royals!).</p><p id=eeUzQpsMTp data-wc=37>Then it was straight back down to the crowds to get a sense of the mood.

Reporter <a class=hm-link href=#>Isabelle Casey</a>, who could not have been more lovely. Our smiles say it all! Anticipation was high, a sort of frenzied energy that is unique to the royal crowds I’ve waited in — even as the rain persisted. (London showed us the damp, drizzly weather it is known for all morning. But since it rained on both Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation in 1953 and her father’s in 1937, it felt quite fitting.)</p><p id=exlbY9zq7xp data-wc=73>Before too long, we got word that King Charles and <a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Camilla&nbsp;</a>had left Buckingham Palace en route for Westminster Abbey. The on-hand HELLO! team squeezed onto what space remained on the sidewalk to catch a glimpse of the monarch. We heard the procession before we saw it, the unmistakable sound of horse hooves turning the corner. When the coach emerged, surrounded by uniformed guards, it looked like something out of a storybook.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="All the photos and footage from Prince Louis's first royal engagement!" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f1f8ed46509f-gettyimages-1253151786.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="All the photos and footage from Prince Louis's first royal engagement!" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>All the photos and footage from Prince Louis's first royal engagement!</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eeKL8XLePb data-wc=51>I thought.

The king seemed to glow, his face framed by the white fur top of his Robe of State. I remember being surprised at the sight of his bare head — no crown yet! Just his nearly white hair neatly combed into his signature deep side part. I flung my hand up in a very over-the-top American wave, joining the crowds as they fluttered their flags and clapped their hands. It was a brilliant start, as the Brits would say, to witnessing this historic day.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>The royal carriage passes by Elizabeth Holmes and HELLO! staffers reporting from Whitehall.</figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9194b128251b-coronationday-79.jpg><p id=ePous4jwfW data-wc=52>We headed back upstairs, and out of the rain, to catch the other arrivals on the television. <a class=hm-link href=#>There I got my first glimpse of Catherine, the Princess of Wales.</a> There had been so much debate about what she would wear on her head: Would it be a tiara? Or a flower crown?&nbsp;</p><p id=eAJyCLS4pVd data-wc=66>“Of course!” I shouted when I saw her silver bullion and embroidered headpiece, a collaboration between Jess Collett and Alexander McQueen. The two-tiered triangle leaf design was both of those things, and to me is the defining accessory of the coronation (crowns aside, of course). It felt sufficiently formal for this historic occasion without being flashy, walking that fine line of being special but not showy</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2acf3d6a7b3e-coronationday-88.jpg><p id=eYAzvc6bekW data-wc=79><a class=hm-link href=#>And her robe!</a> The speculation about Catherine’s dress was nearly for naught in the end, given that it was hidden under the voluminous red, white, and blue robe the princess wore at the request of Charles and Camilla. The covering gave Catherine, as well as Prince William and Sophie and Edward, the<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh,&nbsp;</a>an almost uniform-like feel as they sat in the front row. The message was clear: They were there to support the sovereign.</p><p id=e7lblemWJm4 data-wc=104><a class=hm-link href=#>At the sight of the three Wales children</a>, I’m quite certain I let out an audible “Aww.” I have watched with fascination as the public presence of this trio grows, and a pang in my heart as a mother of three myself. What an awesome but harrowing moment, to see these three on hand to witness their grandfather’s crowning. <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince George</a> looked dapper in his page boy uniform and mischievous <a class=hm-link href=#>Louis was so handsome in his custom tunic.</a> But <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Charlotte</a>, with her matching headpiece and braided updo, was my favorite — a vision in her white caped Alexander McQueen, twinning with her mother.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="King Charles III's coronation in 30 memorable pictures" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4c953c5b975d-coronation-best-pics.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="King Charles III's coronation in 30 memorable pictures" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>King Charles III's coronation in 30 memorable pictures</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=epDY88_qdb data-wc=127>My heart swelled again <a class=hm-link href=#>seeing Prince Harry heading into the Abbey with a smile.</a> I wished desperately that his wife and children were there with him, but I exhaled at the sight of him in good spirits at this charged moment. Later we learned he wore custom Dior, a brand that famously dressed his mother — particularly at the end of her royal tenure and into her life as a divorcee. In a day when there was not much Princess Diana (<a class=hm-link href=#>save for Catherine’s statement pearl and diamond earrings</a>, from Diana’s collection) it felt like a very special touch. Also, for anyone up in arms about the choice of a French fashion house, here’s your reminder that the Dior menswear artistic director Kim Jones is a Brit.&nbsp;</p><p id=e15C7luaIfk data-wc=62>From what the cameras showed, Harry seemed to take being seated in the third row in stride, which couldn’t have been easy.

Her gown, by British couturier Bruce Oldfield, felt particularly fitting for her consort role, there to support the sovereign. Along with the all-but-required symbols of the United Kingdom were far more personal touches: wildflowers, delicate bunting, books! Flanking either side of the cypher along the front center hem of the skirt were her two rescue dogs, Bluebell and Beth. And on her robe, designed by the Royal School of Needlework for her departure from the Abbey, a coronation first: embroidered insects, including bees, butterflies, a beetle and a caterpillar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/09025f2593b5-coronationday-91.jpg><p id=e8O9BNjv5h data-wc=115>As the coronation service got underway, I stepped away from watching to film with Isabelle again, offering up my first take on these ensembles. &nbsp;The closer I looked, the more exquisite it all was. It was a tall order to make this coronation — something most people had never seen before — appear grand but not indulgent; to read the room on the economic hardships facing Britain at the moment, but deliver on the fairytale promise that draws so many into following the royal family. Together with the 2,000 other invited guests in the Abbey, the Windsors delivered a visual feast of photographs that will fill the pages of history books for decades to come.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d1ca57421dc1-coronationday-95.jpg><p id=egeg4UsoQ0 data-wc=87>The person who surprised me the most was the man at the center of it all: <a class=hm-link href=#>King Charles himself.&nbsp;</a>As I was preparing for this day, in an attempt to understand these ancient rituals, I watched Queen Elizabeth II’s 1953 crowning. I’ve studied countless pictures, too, enchanted by a 27-year-old woman on the global stage. She looked nervous at times during the service, but held her shoulders back and her chin high.

The new king, at age 74, looked at turns moved and overwhelmed. Was there a hint of sadness in his eyes? It was as if you could feel the literal weight of the crown — and all its responsibilities — on his shoulders. I hadn’t expected his full-face smile (though he does have a fantastic smile!) but I had thought there would be a little bit more optimism or conviction in this moment. Instead, I was reminded of the turmoil of the last few years and <a class=hm-link href=#>the profound loss of his mother after a history-making reign.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/86750f2a9864-coronationday-115.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4b961479e375-coronationday-100.jpg><p id=e6T97neSvDk data-wc=91>How should a king look when he is crowned? That question was on my mind as I went back downstairs to catch the procession from the Abbey to the Palace. I wondered if I was bringing too much of my emotive American self to this situation. After all, a coronation is a solemn service between the sovereign and God. Here was a man, who has lived a very public and highly scrutinized life, humbly accepting the duties bestowed upon him. “I come not to be served, but to serve,” he said.</p><p id=eFCKuK2PYXt data-wc=86>And yet, what is a coronation if not a celebration, the start of a new chapter of a centuries-long story? Returning to my spot on the sidewalk, which was somehow even more packed in the persistent rain, I waited. The display kicking off the king’s procession was impressive in its sound and scale, with marching bands that made your heart beat faster. The striking precision of the troops, the swords glistening in the rain, the towering bearskin hats — nobody does pageantry quite like the Brits.</p><p id=e10nAKlQTg-8Fm data-wc=26>The anticipation grew with each marching moment, until the sight of the Gold State Coach ignited the cheers.

King William IV said riding in it is like being in a ship “tossing in a rough sea,” while Queen Victoria lamented its “distressing oscillation.” (I went to see it the next morning at the Royal Mews and was blown away by its size; the wheels are nearly as tall as I am.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ce8c3f456e63-coronationday-146.jpg><p id=env4MW38nl data-wc=108><a class=hm-link href=#>Then came the Waleses,</a> the five of them tucked into a covered coach just behind the king and queen. The three kids had their backs to the horses, with Louis on one window, Charlotte on the other, and George in the middle. I caught a glimpse of Catherine’s headpiece but it was her daughter who made me wave a little faster. The eight-year-old princess’s eyes danced, scanning down to the crowd on the street and up to the people waving flags out of the windows above.<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;I beamed back at her awe-struck smile,</a> reminding me of the pictures of then-Princess Elizabeth on her father’s coronation day in 1937.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>Elizabeth and HELLO! reporter Isabelle Casey react to all the royals passing by post-coronation.</figure><p id=eaw4DO0wdd data-wc=144>Once we caught our breath, it was back up to the flat once more t<a class=hm-link href=#>o catch the balcony appearance on television</a>. One of my favorite photos in my book, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>HRH</a>, is Elizabeth greeting the crowds on her coronation day with a wide, sincere smile. The king looked more to be soaking it in, with the hint of a smile and emotion in his eyes. I can’t imagine what he was thinking; just seeing the images on television of thousands of people streaming up the mall was staggering. I noticed Getty royal photographer Chris Jackson’s head pop up behind the couple, capturing the moment from a (literal) behind-the-scenes view. The royal family later shared one of them on Instagram, with the couple waving to the sea of people below. It was a visual clapback of those aforementioned polls, as if to say: Apathy? What apathy?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b2991721cce1-coronationday-151.jpg><p id=ebI45hFZRf data-wc=42>The flypast flew directly over our flat, their streams of red, white, and blue visible through the large skylight en route to Buckingham Palace.
