She works as a licensed emergency nurse at Eisenhower Health in Rancho Mirage, California.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/natalie-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Natalie_Ortega_Speaks_Two_Languages></span>Natalie Ortega Speaks Two Languages&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Growing up, Natalie Ortega’s grandmother taught her Spanish while babysitting her, which is why she’s bilingual in English and Spanish today. In a recent interview, Jenna Ortega revealed that her mum has always hoped for Jenna and her siblings to be bilingual. But achieving this has been challenging since her husband, Edward Ortega, can’t speak Spanish. This challenge was one of the reasons Jenna took on Wednesday’s role, which made her embrace her Latina culture and heritage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/338920034_180030304879203_4914441349440776445_n22.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Famous_Is_Natalie_Ortega></span>How Famous Is Natalie Ortega?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Natalie Ortega may not be a Hollywood star, but her being Jenna Ortega’s mother has made her popular on Instagram with over 17K followers.

However, that is not the case with this emergency nurse. Like her daughter, Natalie Ortega is highly dedicated to her profession. In fact, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Natalie Ortega worked actively as an emergency nurse at Eisenhower. She used social media to encourage people to do their part to reduce the spread of the disease.</p><p>In April 2020, Jenna Ortega’s mum posted a selfie on her Instagram from Eisenhower Health, where she wrote:</p><p>“Never did I think I’d be working as an emergency nurse during a pandemic. Definitely scary times.”&nbsp;</p><p>She captioned the image;</p><p>“Please be kind to one another and do your part to help flatten the curve. Help end #covid19 #stayhome.”</p><p>Natalie Ortega’s dedication to helping others goes beyond her current role as an emergency nurse.

During her debut on Saturday Night Live, Jenna Ortega shared how she began her career in the entertainment industry. Ortega disclosed that she has been acting since she was a child, and her journey began when her mother uploaded a video of her on Facebook and she got discovered.</p><p>As much as posting videos and taking little Jenna to her auditions largely contributed to her acting success, Jenna’s parents also balanced things out for their overly famous daughter by treating her like every other teenage girl. In her interview with <a href=#>Press Cycle</a> Jenna described this as one of the things she loves about her family.&nbsp;</p><p>In this interview, she said:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“Another thing I love about them is that they don’t care at all about what I do. They have no interest whatsoever in this world or in the film industry. I could come home from work with cool people, prominent people, people I looked up to, and they weren’t interested. They were like, ‘Hey, you didn’t do the dishes before you left, so you’re going to have to do them all week’.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/289334594_372131161478610_8975710312398972563_n-820x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jennas_Ortegas_Journey_in_Showbiz></span>Jenna’s Ortega’s Journey in Showbiz<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jenna Ortega’s acting history began at the young age of 8 in 2010 when she started trying out at auditions with her mum.
