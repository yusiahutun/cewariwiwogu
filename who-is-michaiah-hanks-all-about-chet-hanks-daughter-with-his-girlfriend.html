She is better known as the granddaughter of actor Tom Hanks. Her father, Chet Hanks, has starred in prominent roles in the TV series Empire and Shameless.</p><p>Chet’s daughter was not born into a serious relationship, but her father considers her the best thing that ever happened to him. He says that Mikey helped him change his life. At no point does he fail to mention how much his daughter means to him.</p><p>But who is Mishaya’s mother? How did she meet Chet Hanks? Were they just friends? And how much does Tom himself adore Michaiah? Find out below.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Michaiah Hanks’ Parents Were Never In A Relationship&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Hanks was born in April 2016. She has Greek, Bulgarian, Portuguese, and English ancestry on her father’s side. On her mother’s side, Michaiah is of African-American descent. Her mother is from Indio, California.</p><p>Michaiah’s mother, Tiffany Miles, was neither Chet’s girlfriend nor did they have any romantic relationship. From what I hear, they simply had a one-night stand when the celebrity’s son was drunk.</p><p>However, Chet claims that the woman who gave him his daughter is the nicest person he has ever met.</p><p>The heavily tattooed artist also paid a heartfelt tribute to his daughter’s black mother, Miles, during the George Floyd protests. Posting a series of Instagram photos showing him standing in front of George Floyd’s artwork, Chet wrote how grateful he was for Tiffany, calling her “the mother of my child and a beautiful black woman”.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>What Happened To Kalecia Williams?

However, this post has since been deleted. In the video, the actor and musician said,</p><p>“I want to share something today because it’s about to be shared anyway in the press, which is the fact that I have a daughter. I do have a daughter, she’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me, she’s the reason why I turned my life around and got sober.”</p><p>At the time, Chet also revealed that he has been abstinent from everything for more than a year and a half. He added that his daughter should not be publicized and that she is something that he loves and that has changed his life.</p><p>However, it wasn’t until February 2019 that the proud father came out for the first time with his daughter, Misha Hicks, in La Quinta, California.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Michaiah Hanks’ Father Is An Actor & Singer</strong></h2><p>Despite having a lot of experience with the screen, Chet Hanks hasn’t yet gained the huge fame that his father has over the decades. However, Michaiah’s father has had recurring roles in hits such as Empire and Shameless. He also starred as Joey Maldini in the Showtime legal drama miniseries Your Honor. Some of the films he has appeared in include Bratz, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Larry Crowne, Project X, Fantastic Four, and Greyhouse.</p><p>In addition to acting, Chet is also a musician and rapper. In 2011, he recorded the song “White and Purple” under the pseudonym Chet Haze. The song was a remix of Wiz Khalifa’s single “Black and Yellow”.</p><p>In 2016, Chet formed the musical duo FTRZ with Drew Arthur. Two years later, they released two singles (“Models” and “NowhereLand”), as well as the EP “Ocean Park”. The duo then released two tracks in 2020, “Harley” and “Ticket Out My Head”, under the new name Something Out West.</p><p>Mikaya’s mother, Tiffany Miles, is a graduate of California State University. She also interns at Moguldom Media Group LLC. Miles works in the news industry in downtown Louth. She helps manage YouTube, Twitter, and email accounts. Her other jobs include running the teleprompter during live broadcasts, handling paperwork, and preparing equipment for red-carpet appearances.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Michaiah Hanks’ Famous Grandparents</strong></h2><p>As already mentioned, Mihai was born into a famous family. Her grandfather needs no introduction. Her grandfather Tom is one of the most popular and recognizable film stars in the world and is considered an icon of American culture by people all over the world.</p><p>Mihai’s grandfather’s films have grossed more than $4.9 billion in North America and more than $9.96 billion worldwide, making him the fourth-highest-grossing actor in North America.</p><p>Tom is best known for Splash, The Bachelor Party, Big, and A League of Their Own. He has won two consecutive Academy Awards (Best Actor) for Philadelphia (1993) and the title role in Forrest Gump (1994).</p><p>Mihai’s great-grandfather was the husband of actress Samantha Luisa from 1978 to 1987. His son, Colin Hanks, is also an actor. Tom and Samantha also had a daughter, Elizabeth Hanks.</p><p>Forrest Gump was married for 33 years to actress Rita Wilson (also Maisie’s grandmother). Hanks and Wilson have two sons. The eldest son, Chester Marlon “Chet” Hanks, is Maisie’s dad, and the youngest son is Truman Theodore, who was born in 1995. The Hanks family lives in Los Angeles, California, and Ketchum, Idaho.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Michaiah’s Relationship With The Hanks Family</strong></h2><p>The Hanks family is absolutely in love with Michaiah, and according to an insider,</p><p>“They (the Hanks) have fallen in love with the little girl. They adore that baby and even spent Halloween with her. She will always be loved and taken care of by the Hanks family.”</p><p>The aspiring rapper received help from his Academy Award-winning father as Tom helped Chet with his financial expenses, including the $2,800 rent of his Santa Monica home. The Forrest Gump actor also helped Chet’s daughter, who at the time was in the full custody of Tiffany.</p><p>Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks once revealed that they were great-grandparents to their grandchildren, including Micah.</p><p>“We’re the cool grandparents,”</p><p>Wilson said.</p><p>“I think [we’re] the coolest,” her longtime husband added.</p><p>Tom and Rita agreed that they don’t feel the need for TV, radio, or books when their grandchildren are around. However, they added that the grandchildren just put up with them. “Sometimes they just look at us like, “What?”. Wilson revealed.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Navy Joan Roberts-Missing Grandchild Of Joe Biden; Who is Her Mother</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Michaiah’s Father Struggled With Substance Abuse</strong></h2><p>Hanks’ father Chet struggled with addictions in the past. He has been open and apologetic about them in several interviews.</p><p>Chet revealed in November 2014 that he had <a href=# rel=noopener>struggled with substance abuse since 16</a>, but was cured in his mid-20s. In June 2015, he made headlines for using the N-word on Instagram. A few weeks later, some sources reported that he had disappeared.</p><p>Through an Instagram video, he revealed that he had been selling coke until he could no longer even sniff up his nose “because it was so blocked”. Mikey’s father said he even smoked crack. He also vandalized a hotel room, posing with guns, and was repeatedly treated in rehab.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Michaiah-Hanks-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Michaiah Helped Her Father Get Sober</strong></h2><p>As mentioned, Chet has quite a reputation for doing things out of his mind; the star has dabbled in drugs, which in turn has got his famous parents into trouble.</p><p>Mihai’s father caused a car accident in mid-2016 while allegedly under the influence. But Chet was driving his parents’ car. They were later sued by the victim, named Terry Morgan.</p><p>Chet himself suffered blows and a brain injury. Parties and trouble were all that characterized Tom and Rita’s first child.</p><p>Fast forward, those days seem to be behind them, and Chet owes it all to his daughter, Micah. The Empire star says her daughter is the best thing that has ever happened to him. He claims that Michaiah is the reason why he changed his life and became abstinent. “I’ve been abstinent from everything for over a year and a half,” said the “Shameless” actor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Quick Facts about Michaiah Hanks</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-table aligncenter is-style-stripes"><table class=alignleft><tbody readability=4.5><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td><strong>Michaiah Hanks</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>3 feet 1 inch</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$ 10 million USD (Father)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Celebrity child</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>19kg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Zodiac</strong></td><td>Aries</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>6 years old</td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>Los Angeles, California, USA</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Body Measurement</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td>April 16, 2016</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>African-American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother</strong></td><td>Tiffany Miles Read</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother Profession</strong></td><td>Broadcasting journalist</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father</strong></td><td>Chet Hanks</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father Profession</strong></td><td>Actor and Musician</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Current residence</strong></td><td>Palm Springs, California Read</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqWZmLWitcChZKGZnqDAbq3LpWSamp%2BqwW6vx56rZqCRo7i0ecOarKCgpJq%2FbsPIrZ9moJmoeqi10aWdq6GVo7Fw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./caitlin-burles.html>&#171;&nbsp;Caitlin Burles - Bio, Net Worth, Height, Career, In Relation, Facts</a>
