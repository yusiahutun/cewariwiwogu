That, in many minds, is enough to put the 22-year-old Iowa star among the greats of college basketball.</p><p>But even after<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> passing Kelsey Plum atop the NCAA women’s list</a></strong> and perhaps Lynette Woodard’s women’s major college basketball record and Pete Maravich on the men’s side, does Clark need a national title to stand alongside the likes of Cheryl Miller, Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore and Chamique Holdsclaw?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Countdown stays at 8 as the Huskers hold Caitlin Clark scoreless in the 4th and pull off the upset. A shocker on multiple levels.</p>— Hawkeye Headquarters (@HawkeyeHQ) <a href=#>February 11, 2024</a></figure><p>“I do think she’ll be up there,” South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said. “I do.”</p><p>Clark, who’s averaging 32.1 points this season, has 3,520 career points and needs eight more to pass Plum’s record of 3,527 for Washington from 2013-17. The milestone is all but certain to happen Thursday night when Clark and the Hawkeyes host Michigan.</p><p>Clark also could pass Detroit Mercy’s Antoine Davis (3,664 points) and perhaps even Maravich, who put up 3,667 points for LSU in three seasons from 1967-70.</p><p>Staley was national player of the year while helping Virginia to three Final Fours from 1989-92. But she finished her college career without a title, something she believes should not take away from what Clark has accomplished.</p><p>The 22-year-old Clark excels in an era when the women’s game is bursting with growth and new fans in the arenas and on TV, Staley said.</p><p>“Even the ones who are just starting to see her will be talking about her greatness,” Staley said, “and that’s something some of the other greats didn’t have.”</p><p>Pearl Moore, like Staley a member of the Naismith Hall of Fame, remembers too well how few people paid attention to the women’s game when she played at Francis Marion in the late 1970s and became the most prolific women’s scorer in history.</p><p>No matter where Clark finishes this season, she’s unlikely to catch Moore’s mark of 4,061 points from 1975-79. Moore’s total is not recognized in the NCAA’s scoring list because she played in the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW).</p><p>No matter, she said: Clark has brought the game to a bigger stage.</p><p>“It’s great to see so many people paying attention,” Moore said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Caitlin says she’s not anxious about breaking the scoring record — more so in just having fun <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/GtEdvgRkfy</a></p>— Blake Hornstein (@BlakeHornTV) <a href=#>February 14, 2024</a></figure><p>Former Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw, who won two NCAA titles in 2001 and 2018 with the Fighting Irish, believes Clark has established her spot, whether she and the Hawkeyes win the national tournament or not.</p><p>The lines of fans, young and old, can be both a joy for Clark to draw from or an added level of pressure for her to live up.

Iowa reached the title game a year ago by beating Staley’s undefeated, No. 1 Gamecocks, 77-73. But they were beaten soundly for the championship by LSU, 102-85.</p><p>Afterward, a visibly upset Clark said she wanted her legacy to be on her young fans and the people of Iowa. “I was that young girl,” she said. “All you have to do is dream and you can be in moments like this.”</p><p>Clark has a staunchly loyal fanbase that will rise to her defense, something four-time WNBA champion and three-time league MVP Sheryl Swoopes found out this past month. Swoopes, who led Texas Tech to the 1993 national title, mistakenly pointed out that Clark should’ve broken Plum’s record in four seasons when Clark actually will surpass Plum in fewer games.</p><p>Swoopes went on to say Clark dominates as “a 25-year-old playing against a 20-year-old.” <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Iowa responded with a fact-checking post</a></strong> on X, formerly known as Twitter, that detailed the 22-year-old Clark’s career.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>For those new to <a href=#>@IowaWBB</a>, Caitlin Clark turned 22 on 1/22 and the screenshot below has all of the statistical information you might need to discuss the points she's scored, the number of shots she's put up and the years she's played in her college career. <a href=#>#Hawkeyes</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jBi4HTijFn</a></p>— Ryan M.

Four-time NBA champion and two-time league MVP Steph Curry of Golden State has enjoyed watching Clark’s quick release on her shot and her stellar floor game.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry talks about the comparisons between his shooting style and Iowa’s Caitlin Clark’s.

Antonelli said Clark has worked during her time in college to make herself unguardable. McGraw sees Clark as an accomplished passer; she moved past 1,000 assists — just the third ever to accomplish that among women — in a loss to Nebraska last Sunday.</p><p>“I don’t understand why more teams don’t double her,” said McGraw, always the coach. “Who do you think’s going to take the shot?”</p><p>Author Joanne Lonnin, who wrote “Finding a Way To Play: The Pioneering Spirit of Women in Basketball,” has followed Clark’s rise and chase of the scoring crown.
