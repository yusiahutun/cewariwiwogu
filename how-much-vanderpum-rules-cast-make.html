It really is going back in time, and it really is me in a very different place than I’m at right now,” she said. “There’s good days and there’s bad days. There’s ups and there’s downs. There’s definitely going to be those moments—the dancing, having-fun feeling like, I got this. And then there’s going to be moments where maybe I don’t got this.
