It seems like it was only yesterday when we began this beautiful love story. It's been a year since we started, and we have had unforgettable moments together. Since we started this beautiful love story, there has not been a single day in which we have not enjoyed all the happiness our love gives us. At first, there was nothing like the love between us, but as we kept meeting on and off, our feelings for each other started to take shape. As time went by, we kept falling more in love with each other. Every time we met, there seemed to be something different about you that mesmerized me and made me think about you for hours afterwards. My love for you has grown bigger and stronger. I feel I am the happiest guy on earth because I have you with me, and every day I realize that we are made for each other. With 12 months gone, and a lifetime to go, I promise to love you with each new day. Happy anniversary, baby girl! <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c15a18bcb197f013.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best happy 15th wedding anniversary wishes for a couple</span></p></a>With a great smile on my face, I'm writing this letter that marks our one-year anniversary. Three hundred sixty-five days have already gone by since I gave you my heart which you have filled with 1,001 treasures. This is the day on which our beautiful love story celebrates its first year of existence. From the first time I set my eyes on you even till now, I have never loved you any less than before. I never imagined there could exist a woman with such striking beauty and such an amazing intelligence and, as if it were not enough, had a heart full of such beautiful feelings. So I could not help but fall in love with you forever. You make my life complete. You make all my dreams come true, and you constantly amaze me with your love and devotion. I promise that I will dedicate every day of my life to you to make you happy and to love you. Happy anniversary to you, my love.
