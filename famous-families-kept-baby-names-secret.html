While the couple first told fans the baby's name was Wolf, they later shared that they no longer felt it was fitting for him. Over the course of the next few months, the parents went back and forth on the infant's name with Kylie jokingly sharing on "The Kardashians" that they were "just waiting for him to name himself."</p><p>Just a month before the baby's first birthday, Kylie finally revealed that they had <a href=#>decided on the name Aire</a>.</p><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>Cardi B</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Offset</strong></a></p><p>After Cardi B and her husband Offset welcomed their second child in September 2021, they waited seven months to finally share his name. In April 2022, the couple revealed that they named the little boy Wave and posted the first photos of his face. When asked why they waited so long to share, Cardi says she was trying her best to protect her family.</p><p>"We went through a lot of sad things when it comes to Kulture -- terrible behavior that not even the older kids have ever been through. So many people will post mean, disgusting things, just to get a reaction from us.

Several months after her birth, Ryan confirmed that the newborn was a baby girl but still refused to share her name.</p><p>"We're gonna be original, and all the letters in her name are silent. I want to give her something to push against in life," he joked on the "<a href=#>Today</a>" show.</p><p>It was actually Blake and Ryan's good friend Taylor Swift who spilled the beans on the little girl's name, <a href=#>titling her song "Betty</a>" in her honor.

In another interview she noted that she had no further plans to talk about the baby boy or her husband.</p><p>"Every instinct in my body wants to protect their privacy for the rest of their lives, as much as I can.
