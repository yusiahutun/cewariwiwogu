We get it: Red is timeless, flatters all skin tones, and can be worn in varieties from sheer to opaque, depending on the look and style you’re trying to nail. But we’d like to make an appeal for another iconic and versatile shade —&nbsp;pink.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pink is one of the most diverse color options in the spectrum, with hues ranging from pastel bubblegum to bright fuchsia to juicy berries and everything in between to enhance all complexions. Regardless of where you’re headed (the office? A gala?) or the vibe you’re trying to cultivate, there’s a pink that’s perfect for the occasion. And thanks to the new Barbie movie, it seems society is starting to get on board.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, we firmly believe that pink lipstick absolutely shouldn’t be a trend, but rather a staple of your regular makeup routine. Not sure where to get started? You can’t go wrong starting with a sheer wash of color in a buildable, balm-like formula. But with all the glorious finishes out there, from conditioning tints to bright and shiny glosses, you won’t be able to pick just one.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-nars-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nars Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WkMr6RJndPsIhPkdw1enIKnLdlQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nars-lipstick-3d41fd5d5f8140f5bd3a75bbf2d75c74.jpg"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This shade is vivid and long-lasting without feeling drying on the lips.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The rubberized packaging gets sticky over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shade Name: Schiap</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve been rocking this pink lipstick for over 15 years and have no plans to stop anytime soon, especially considering that Nars reformulated it to make it even more comfortable. Named for fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, who made “shocking pink” her signature shade back in the 1930s, the punchy hue pops on all skin tones and makes for a perfect accent to any outfit, especially an all-black one (we love the sophisticated contrast).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While some matte lipsticks can read as chalky post-application, the finish of this one leans satiny, almost like a rose petal, to give the lips a smoothed-out look that won’t call attention to fine lines. The silky, moisturizing texture also doesn’t budge, so you don’t have to worry about it wearing off midday or feathering, even if you skip out on wearing lip liner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our only frustration with this lipstick is its packaging. The formula is flawless, but the tube it’s housed in features Nars’ signature rubberized finish. Over time, this material wears down, taking on a sticky feel that picks up all the dirt in your makeup bag. For this reason, we’ve always held on to the lipstick’s carton, which goes a long way in helping to preserve the integrity of the tube.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet<strong>｜Coverage Level: </strong>Full<strong>｜Finish: </strong>Matte<strong>｜Key Ingredients: </strong>Passion fruit seed oil, moringa oil<strong>｜Size: </strong>0.12 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-loral-glow-paradise-balm-in-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L'Oréal Balm-in-Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lnQA3arUsYIYFgqIRzQmsneg3mQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loreal-glow-paradise-balm-in-lipstick-in-nude-heaven-e16e3fbe9e2c4984a4c2245c4e0bd346.jpg"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This cushy lipstick truly feels like a lip balm.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish it lasted longer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shade Name: Nude Heaven</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for an affordable lipstick that you can throw in your bag and apply on the go without the assistance of a mirror, we’d highly recommend this one from L’Oréal Paris. It’s remarkably comfortable thanks to moisturizing pomegranate extract, living up to its name of “balm in lipstick,” and comes in a wide range of flattering neutrals, including this pinky hue. With just one swipe, you’ll give your lips a glaze of medium-coverage color that makes them look plump and healthy. And, though it’s a small detail, we also appreciate the clear cap — we have several shades of this formula and it’s nice to be able to see which shade we’re grabbing with a quick glance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because it offers medium coverage with a balmy finish, it wears off easily, so you’ll have to touch up throughout the day to keep up your look. That said, because it’s so easy and fuss-free to apply (as well as hydrating!), you likely won’t mind reapplying.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet<strong>｜Coverage Level: </strong>Medium<strong>｜Finish: </strong>Satin/balm<strong>｜Key Ingredients: </strong>Pomegranate extract<strong>｜Size:</strong> 0.1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-maybelline-superstay-matte-ink-lip-color></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maybelline SuperStay Matte Ink Lip Color</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ulta Maybelline SuperStay Matte Ink Lip Color in Romantic" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/AhXb0pzXU9ooX1gMQDtkh3eDUGc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/maybelline-superstay-matte-ink-lip-color-in-romantic-07c4cedf09d44cc29d89a3e54673a632.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This vibrant formula doesn’t budge.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Its exceptional longwear properties can make it tough to remove.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shade Name: Romantic</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This eye-popping pink is easy to find and just as easy to apply, thanks to a precise and pointed doe-foot applicator. It features a hollow center that holds and deposits just the right amount of color, so you don’t need to go in with extra layers, which tends to cause clumpiness and breakdown in most long-wear formulas. Though the formula doesn’t fully dry down, that’s not a bad thing —&nbsp;it means that the incredibly durable, paraffin-infused matte color stays flexible, so it won’t crack or flake.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This lipstick boasts up to 16 hours of wear, one of the most impressive claims we’ve ever seen on a long-lasting lipstick, so it really fuses to the lips. However, that can also make it a serious challenge to take off. Maybelline offers a remover specifically for this product, but you can also spend some time soaking it off with a nourishing cleansing balm or oil, which will help break down the formula — though don’t be surprised if the lipstick still leaves a stain behind.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Liquid<strong>｜Coverage Level: </strong>Full<strong>｜Finish: </strong>Matte<strong>｜Key Ingredients: </strong>Paraffin<strong>｜Size: </strong>0.17 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-herms-rouge-herms-matte-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hermès Matte Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-fhnE8O5ADmcFoifNIinICBz0N8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hermes-rouge-hermes-matte-lipstick-rose-indien-d26b08a83a4d4abcb36abcbc9a2ed644.jpg"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The chic packaging is refillable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s slightly drying.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shade Name: Rose Indien</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This ultra-luxe lipstick from Hermès not only comes in the brand’s iconic orange box, but a canvas pouch and a sleek tube with elegant white, black, and gold color-blocking and a logo-emblazoned cap. (Trust us, this lipstick delivers a totally sophisticated experience before you even apply it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rose Indien, a blue-toned pink inspired by Rajasthan, the ancient city in Northern India, slides right on and settles into a semi-matte finish. The best part? It’s fully opaque in just two coats and you won’t need to reapply for the rest of the day. The tube is refillable, so once you’ve used up the bullet, you can buy a new one and pop it in, making this high-end lipstick both more economical and sustainable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The velvety-powder finish is supremely stylish, but despite the moisturizing ingredients — including squalane and crambe abyssinica seed oil —&nbsp;it does start to feel a bit drying after a few hours of wear. We suggest prepping your pout with an indulgent balm about 30 minutes before applying this one to keep your lips comfortable, soft, and smooth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet<strong>｜Coverage Level:</strong> Full<strong>｜Finish:</strong> Semi-matte<strong>｜Key Ingredients: </strong>Squalane, white mulberry root extract, crambe abyssinica seed oil<strong>｜Size: </strong>0.12 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-nude-pink-charlotte-tilbury-matte-revolution-pillow-talk-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Nude Pink</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Charlotte Tilbury Matte Revolution Lipstick in Pillow Talk" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/10jjxsROJIx-YEtQn9AADL1-B9o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/charlotte-tilbury-matte-revolution-pillow-talk-lipstick-7e6f05f8c0be44849e0593b40becb14a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Charlotte Tilbury</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This legendary lipstick comes in three different shade iterations to suit all skin tones.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not especially long-lasting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shade Name: Pillow Talk</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to the brand, a tube of this lipstick is sold every two minutes —&nbsp;and that’s because it’s incredibly flattering, comfortable, and stylish. The fluted rose-gold tube gives off Old Hollywood vibes, and the chiseled bullet makes it a breeze to precisely apply. The silky, semi-matte formula fills in fine lines for a plush, smoothed-out pucker and looks incredibly natural, even when you slick it on past the lip line for a fuller appearance. The original nude-pink hue flatters a broad range of skin tones, but you can also buy it in two deeper versions — Medium and Intense —&nbsp;for a richer look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The creamy formula features unique extracts (including one from a plant known as the lipstick tree!) to keep lips both semi-matte and moisturized, but those nourishing properties give it a fairly average wear time of three or so hours, making it require touch-ups after eating. We don’t mind —&nbsp;this keeps the finish fresh.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet<strong>｜Coverage Level: </strong>Full<strong>｜Finish: </strong>Semi-matte<strong>｜Key Ingredients: </strong>Orchid extract, lipstick tree extract<strong>｜Size: </strong>0.12 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-rose-pink-violettefr-petal-bouche-matte></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Rose Pink</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Violette_FR Petal Bouche Matte</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Violette_FR Petal Bouche Matte in Coeur Infid&amp;Atilde;&amp;uml;le" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/L0mWdIvwTR6s6iUQVNZjcov7ivo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/violette-fr-petal-bouche-matte-in-coeur-infidele-99f9aca945224bf58b29e8e1b2bfe673.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Violette_FR</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This formula dries down to a velvety matte finish that doesn’t strip the lips of moisture.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The applicator should be more precise.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shade Name: Coeur Infidèle</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a beautiful rosy pink shade, look no further than Coeur Infidèle from Instagram-beloved Violette_FR. The formula is called “Petal Bouche” for a reason —&nbsp;it gives the lips a velvety, rose petal-like finish in a stunning fuchsia hue. Years in the making, the color is perfectly balanced with tones of blue and pink so that it can be worn by anyone, regardless of their complexion. Try it with a crisp edge, or buff it out with your fingertip for an effortlessly chic and Parisian blurred lip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we appreciate the flatness of the doe-foot applicator, which makes it easy to spread the formula smoothly across the lip, we do wish that its tip was pointed rather than rounded. This would make it easier to precisely apply the product to the perimeter of our lips without overdoing it or creating an unintentional smudge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Liquid<strong>｜Coverage Level: </strong>Full<strong>｜Finish: </strong>Matte<strong>｜Key Ingredients: </strong>Castor seed oil<strong>｜Size: </strong>0.12 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-baby-pink-yves-saint-laurent-rouge-pur-couture-satin-lipstick-collection></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Baby Pink</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Yves Saint Laurent Satin Lipstick Collection</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Yves Saint Laurent Rouge Pur Couture Satin Lipstick Collection in 22 Rose Celebration" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dShkVI8oy_B4mozMKZ5k0ZH2Epc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/yves-saint-laurent-rouge-pur-couture-satin-lipstick-collection-in-22-rose-celebration-c35b1a7608974133929cf8afd29a1a18.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It feels very moisturizing and lightweight on the lips.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The formula contains talc.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shade Name: 22 Rose Celebration</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a true bubblegum pink that evokes “Come on Barbie, let’s go party” vibes, this one from YSL is it. The subtly pearlescent formula features hydrating glycerin and moisturizing beeswax that makes it glide on like a lip balm without feeling heavy or thick (love that).

Despite its rarity, it quickly became a cult favorite of the beauty community (ourselves included); thankfully, Candy Yum-Yum joined the permanent MAC lipstick lineup in 2013 and we’ve been loving the retina-searingly pink shade ever since. Its cotton candy-esque, strong blue undertones make it a fun lip to rock during festival season or on hot summer nights, as does the formula’s lasting wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, you’ll want to plan accordingly when adding this lipstick into your makeup wardrobe. The color is very vivid and its pigment is seriously intense, and stains the lips long after you’ve washed it off. If you’re hoping to wear a light lip color within a few days after sporting Candy Yum-Yum, you’ll have to wait it out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet<strong>｜Coverage Level: </strong>Full<strong>｜Finish: </strong>Matte<strong>｜Key Ingredients: </strong>Castor seed oil, paraffin<strong>｜Size: </strong>0.1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-fair-skin-makeup-by-mario-moistureglow-plumping-lip-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Fair Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Makeup By Mario Lip Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Makeup by Mario MoistureGlow Plumping Lip Serum in Rose Glow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZwFT2b8wFuOg74UlzsODXjYpJUU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/makeup-by-mario-moistureglow-plumping-lip-serum-in-rose-glow-a8d2df0ea6fb4daebb2103d4d9a22c05.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It plumps the lips with a gentle cooling sensation — no burning here.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You’ll have to reapply to maintain the look and color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shade Name: Rose Glow</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you don’t want to overwhelm your fair skin with too much pigment, try this comfy serum lippie from Makeup by Mario.

The berry-pink hue really enhances the golden tones found in olive skin while giving both boss and babe vibes. Its matte finish makes your lips look and feel like suede, depositing serious pigment with just one swipe without weighing you down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like many matte lipsticks, however, it can leave the lips feeling dehydrated after several hours of wear (and if you’re not eating something particularly oily, you’ll get at least six hours out of this formula). We find that applying another coat can ease some of this feeling, though this can also cause the lipstick’s texture to feel too thick on the lips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet<strong>｜Coverage Level:</strong> Full<strong>｜Finish: </strong>Matte<strong>｜Key Ingredients: </strong>Paraffin<strong>｜Size:</strong> 0.14 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dark-skin-tones-jones-road-beauty-lip-tint></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dark Skin Tones</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jones Road Beauty Lip Tint</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jones Road Beauty Lip Tint in Raspberry" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HEghxdIK_pYH2F4rqjAhORxl-kw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jones-road-beauty-lip-tint-in-raspberry-9570635de3544da2a3c517d59840511d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jones Road Beauty</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s easy to build up the opacity of this moisturizing formula.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The color fades in a few hours.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shade Name: Raspberry</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This wildly flattering purple-pink looks stunningly beautiful on deep skin and suits any occasion, from a brunch with friends to a board meeting and everything in between. Formulated with nourishing castor seed oil, it glides on easily, helping to moisturize the lips while adding flattering color. You can go as sheer or as intense as you like with it; a quick swipe delivers medium coverage, but can be layered on for a more pigmented look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, if you want to maintain the vibrancy of the shade, you’ll have to reapply every few hours, as the moisturizing quality of the formula causes it to fade. That said, it wears off evenly — it leaves behind a pretty stain, so you don’t have to worry about any unflattering lip rings or patchiness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet<strong>｜Coverage Level: </strong>Medium<strong>｜Finish: </strong>Satin<strong>｜Key Ingredients: </strong>Castor seed oil<strong>｜Size: </strong>0.06 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-coral-pink-gucci-beauty-roug-a-lvres-satin-lipstick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Coral Pink</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gucci Beauty Satin Lipstick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bloomingdales Gucci Beauty Rouge &amp;Atilde;&amp;nbsp; L&amp;Atilde;&amp;uml;vres Satin Lipstick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/y5JIsqXiEsh3En7nHIuMWvczMaQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gucci-rouge-a-levres-satin-lipstick-in-three-wise-girls-5990bbfea29d4a809df94af69d001262.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bloomingdales</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Beyond the formula, the packaging is absolutely breathtaking.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Because it’s moisturizing, the formula transfers easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shade Name: Three Wise Girls</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Coral pinks can get a bad rap, but we love them —&nbsp;they pop on all skin tones, especially if you’ve gotten a bit of sun, and add a summery, preppy feel to any beauty look. This formula from Gucci goes on like silk and leaves the lips feeling instantly moisturized with a gorgeous, buildable wash of medium-coverage color. We’ll be honest here and say that it’s not just the formula that we love, but also the gilded tube, which features Art Deco-inspired etching designed by the brand’s former creative director Alessandro Michele. Bonus: If you’re not a satin lipstick lover, you can also find this exact shade from Gucci in both matte and sheer iterations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This creamy formula feels great, but does slip around, a common quality in moisturizing lipsticks. We’d suggest wearing this one with a lip primer or liner to help boost the longevity of the shade on your lips and to prevent any potential feathering.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Bullet<strong>｜Coverage Level: </strong>Medium<strong>｜Finish: </strong>Satin<strong>｜Key Ingredients: </strong>Vegan microcristallina wax<strong>｜Size: </strong>0.12 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sheer-tarte-maracuja-juicy-lip-plump></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sheer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tarte Lip Plump</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vqIYjo03sb-cgpwse0yqg3ODgYU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tarte-maracuja-juicy-lip-plump-in-tulip-e2bf256832684a9ea84cad0823f17379.jpg"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This ultra-comfy formula fills in fine lines to make lips look plush.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It doesn’t last long on the lip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shade Name: Tulip</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re fans of Tarte’s entire Maracuja Juicy Lip range, but it’s this sheer lipstick formula (and in particular, this flattering raspberry pink hue) that we find ourselves reaching for most often. It’s made with a blend of nourishing oils that makes the product feel more like a mask —&nbsp;it melts in as soon as you apply to quench thirsty lips while depositing a kiss of color. The unique texture also fills in fine lines, including those at the very border of the lips, to create a plumped-up look without any tingling or irritation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep in mind that because this is a sheer lipstick formula, it won’t last very long, especially because it’s not designed to stain the lip.

True to form for the brand, it comes in beautiful minimalist packaging, from the box (printed with the name of the shade you’ve selected in bold lettering) to the weighty tube. The unique shape (like a traditional bullet lipstick, but with a sleek curve) stands out on your desk and feels great in the hand, as does the satisfying click of the cap.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Based on the quality of the formula and the sophistication of the packaging, we have no qualms about dropping cash on this product, however, it feels like a real shame to throw out such an extravagant tube once the lipstick’s been used up.

One of Cruz’s favorite shades in the pink category is fuchsia due to its vibrancy —&nbsp;this color is a punchy blue-based pink, which you’ll find in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Violette_FR Petal Bouche Matte in Coeur Infidèle</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Hermès Rouge Hermès Matte Lipstick in Rose Indien</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Adds Thomas, “A bold, bright pink lip is a beautiful statement that doesn’t require you to wear much else on your face.”<strong> </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Nars Lipstick in Schiap</a> is one of our favorites for this.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rebecca has always loved pink —&nbsp;it’s her mother’s signature shade, so coveted her lipsticks as a kid —&nbsp;and finds it hard to narrow it down to just a few shades, but often finds herself using soft rose shades (try <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Plump in Tulip</a>) to create romantic, flushed looks on her clients. “Pink is so versatile, which is what makes it so useful in my work,” she says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Your Skin Tone</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While there are absolutely no rules when it comes to wearing makeup, finding a pink lipstick that suits your skin tone will likely make you feel your best when wearing it. To do this, consider two factors —&nbsp;your undertone and your lips’ natural color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To figure out your undertone, look at the inside of your wrist, says Rebecca. “Blue veins indicate cool undertones, green veins indicate warm undertones, and a mix of both blue and green indicate neutral undertones,” she explains. Translation: If you have cool undertones, look for blue-based pinks like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">MAC Cosmetics Matte Lipstick in Candy Yum-Yum</a>, those with warm undertones can seek out lipsticks that lean orange or yellow like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Gucci Rougè a Lèvres Satin Lipstick in Three Wise Girls</a>, and if you have neutral undertones, you can wear it all (lucky you!). Rebecca likes vibrant pinks, berries, and fuchsias on deep skin tones; peachy, rosy, and coral pinks on those with medium complexions, and baby and raspberry pinks on those with fair skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You should also take a look at your lips. “Choosing a shade that is a couple steps up from your natural lip tone evokes a bit more of a dressed-up vibe and is gorgeous for any occasion,” says Thomas. If you want a subtler look, opt for a pink lipstick that’s closer to the color of your lips; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Charlotte Tilbury Matte Revolution Lipstick in Pillow Talk</a> is incredibly popular because it comes in three iterations that are just a slightly enhanced version of many individuals’ natural lip color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If a natural lip is your jam, you’ll want to follow Cruz’s lead, whose rule of thumb when applying makeup to his clients is to keep the look subtle and healthy. For those with fair skin, he recommends a powder pink or opal balm-like formula with a sheer and moisturizing texture, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Makeup by Mario MoistureGlow Plumping Lip Serum in Rose Glow</a>. Those with medium skin tones should go for a lipstick of a similar formula, but in a shade comparable to a medium-colored rose petal. If you have deep skin, go for a bold, satin-finish lipstick.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Have fun choosing a strong shade, because the end result will be more natural than you might expect,” he says. “Strategically apply the color by dabbing it on the upper lip and spread it evenly by rubbing your lips together.” Start lightly, then repeat the process if you want more intensity. “The point of this application is to see a wash of sheer color, rather than a stamp of opaque color,” he explains. We love <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Jones Road Beauty Lip Tint in Raspberry</a> for this.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A quick note: Most of our experts recommended coordinating your pink lip with the rest of your beauty look rather than an outfit — for example, you can add a pop of color with your lip or go for a monochromatic look across eyes, lips, and cheeks — but if you’d like to go matchy-matchy with your ensemble, just keep your undertones in mind for both your outfit and your lipstick for the most flattering outcome.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Formula + Finish</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All lipstick formulas, including pink ones, are a matter of preference, as are finishes. If you’re looking for something bold and durable, go for a matte pink like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Maybelline SuperStay Matte Ink Liquid Lipstick in Romantic</a>. Matte pinks is a beautiful statement that generally does not require a lot of extra work with eye makeup or much else,” says Thomas. If you prefer something softer and more plush looking, Rebecca, recommends looking for a cream, sheer, or gloss formula. You can also go for a satin finish like that of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Byredo Lipstick in Semi Formal</a>. Thomas notes that satin lipsticks will give you both opacity and a hydrated look, but their creamy texture can feather, especially on mature skin —&nbsp;so be sure to pair satin lipsticks with a lip liner to keep them in place.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of what type of lipstick you choose, all of our experts recommend exfoliating lips and keeping them nourished with a rich balm or mask to keep them looking healthy and stave off chapping or cracking. However, this is especially important if you go with a matte formula, which will draw attention to any rough texture on the lips. Adds Cruz, “if you’re going to do a bold matte lip, I recommend using a lip primer underneath to hold the color and minimize flaking.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why is pink lipstick a classic?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pink is a classic because of how flattering and versatile it is. “It’s the closest shade to our lips,” points out Thomas. That said, it wasn’t always a staple. “We really started to see pink lipstick take center stage in the ‘60s,” opines Rebecca, who points out that red was the go-to in the ‘40s and ‘50s.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Back then, so much inspiration was drawn from film — we started to see pink used more in films like Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” From there, pink’s popularity kept growing, becoming a mainstay of the mod makeup trends (think Twiggy’s bubblegum pout), and has remained in makeup bags ever since. and evolved in the mod makeup trends worn by Twiggy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Pink brought something different to the conversation and remained a staple,” says Rebecca.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What skin tone looks best in pink?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t get it twisted — everyone and anyone can look good wearing pink lipstick! It’s really just a matter of finding what works best with your undertones, as we outlined above. “Knowing your undertones and having a simple understanding of color theory can aid in achieving finding the best pink shade for you,” adds Rebecca.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What's the best way to apply pink lipstick?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As Thomas says, the best way to apply lipstick is with confidence! Otherwise, our favorite way to apply any lipstick is straight from the tube. That way, you don’t need any extra tools and it’s easy to do on the go.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, you can always enhance your application. Rebecca suggests putting on bolder colors with a brush for more precision, or accentuating your lip shape by applying lip liner first (be sure to fill in your lips with the pencil for lasting color!). “If you want to create the look of a fuller lip without liner, buff out the lipstick with your finger around the lip line to create natural diffusion,” she adds. You can also try a trendy “blurred” look, says Thomas. “For a soft, kissed-off edge, use a dense, domed eyeshadow brush to diffuse the edges,” she suggests.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Orofino</a> is a beauty writer, editor, and consultant with more than a decade of experience in the industry.
