Due to his absence, the meeting will be delayed until March. The committee is planning to dispense $5 million per qualifying person in the Bay Area.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a statement to DailyMail.com, Walton's chief of staff Natalie Gee said that he was in South America for a friend's birthday party. On Monday, his flight on COPA Airlines was delayed which meant that he missed a connecting flight. As a result, the meeting was canceled.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Gee added: 'This is not a delay for reparations. The final report is due in June. Most certainly, Supervisor Walton has no control over the airlines and flight delays.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The supervisor's chief of staff went on to explain that the reason for the long delay before the meeting can be rescheduled is due to the amount of schedules that have to be taken into account.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-56f00ea5db805191 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/02/07/23/67437677-11724677-image-m-20_1675813033300.jpg height=883 width=634 alt="Supervisor Shamann Walton previously served as president of the city's board of supervisors between 2021 and 2023" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Supervisor Shamann Walton previously served as president of the city's board of supervisors between 2021 and 2023</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In May 2021, city officials approved a task force that will study financial compensation, community programs and other ways to make reparations to the descendants of slaves, becoming the largest city to take such a step.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Walton, 47, posted a photo on his Instagram page from a party being held for a friend at a Hooters restaurant in Medellin.
