The disgraced former <a href=# title=_self>Today star</a> is reportedly close to <a href=#>finalizing his divorce</a> from his <a href=#>wife, Annette Roque</a>, and now it’s been reported by <a href=# rel=dofollow>Page Six</a> that he’s agreed to pay her $20 million in their split because he feels bad about cheating on her with women at work.</p><p>“Matt’s bending over backwards to give Annette everything she wants because he feels so guilty. But he would love the Hamptons home,” an insider revealed to the news outlet. Since Matt <a href=# rel=dofollow>sold his Upper East Side apartment</a>, both parties have been spending time at their 12-bedroom Hamptons estate.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/annette-roque-matt-lauer.jpg><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Photo Credit: Getty Images)</p><p>And for now, the former duo is amicable. “Things really have settled down. Matt and Annette are getting on and they’re both spending time with their kids. They hope to settle the divorce very soon,” an insider revealed to the news outlet.&nbsp;</p><p>This payout news comes a few weeks after it was reported Matt was “furious” that he might have to pay Annette $50 million. “He’s going to be forking out around $50 million in a settlement,” an insider previously revealed to <a href=# title=_self>Us Weekly</a>. “She will receive the horse farm, their current residence, and a one-time payment of $25 million.”</p><p>“There will be no child or spousal support and they will split the costs for the kids,” the source added of the longtime <a href=#>couple’s three children</a>, Jack, 17, Romy, 14, and Thijs, 11.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/matt-lauer-annette-roque.jpg><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Photo Credit: Getty Images)</p><p>“Matt is furious he is essentially handing over half of his net worth to Annette. He could fight for a better deal in court but that would only result in dragging this out longer and negative headlines. He is ready to move on with his life and truly believes that a television comeback is possible,” the insider shared at the time.</p><p>Following Matt’s November 2017 <a href=# title=_self>firing from Today</a> over sexual misconduct allegations, the 60-year-old star was reportedly in “bad shape” and worried about the fate of his marriage to Annette, 51.</p><p>“Matt cut himself off from the life he knew in Manhattan and has remained for the most part isolated [<a href=#>in the Hamptons</a>]. He looks exhausted. Matt is finally coming to terms with the reality that his marriage is over and he is in bad shape,” a source revealed at the time.</p><p>“He feels he lost everything important in his life overnight. He is <a href=#>embarrassed and ashamed</a>,” the insider <a href=# title=_self>told Entertainment Tonight</a>. “There is no chance at this point they will work things out. Matt held on to the idea that Annette might eventually forgive him because she had always stuck by him but now he has no hope.”</p><p>A source also previously confessed that Annette planned to receive a “very good settlement” in her divorce from Matt (it seems like she’s getting just that). “Annette is angry. She feels Matt’s behavior has affected a lot of people and has embarrassed the whole family. She wants to make sure she and the children will always be well taken care of. <a href=#>Matt feels terrible</a> and regrets his behavior but his regret isn’t enough right now. It feels like all doors have closed for him,” the insider explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/matt-lauer-splash.jpg><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Photo Credit: Splash)</p><p>Following Matt’s Today scandal, an insider told <a href=# title=_self>Life & Style</a> that the TV star once hoped that he and Annette — who previously filed for divorce in 2006 citing “mental abuse, extreme mental and emotional distress, humiliation, torment, and anxiety” — could reconcile their 19-year marriage. “Matt’s begging Annette not to divorce him. He’s trying to convince her that this scandal could actually make them stronger. He’s making promises, saying all the right things, and he’s more available than ever. Annette sees that, but she’s still very conflicted,” the insider revealed in January.</p><p>Even before his firing, Matt and Annette’s marital issues were allegedly not a secret to those around them. In fact, a former Today employee once revealed that “everyone on staff” knew that <a href=#>Matt was regularly unfaithful</a> to his spouse. “His wife lives in the Hamptons and he lives in [NYC], but we never heard he made unwanted moves. Everyone on staff knew he cheated regularly on his wife. That wasn’t a secret, but sexual [misconduct] is a shock. He was friendly and approachable with everyone, and was very well-liked,” the insider said.
