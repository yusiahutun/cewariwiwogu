Technology has taken over the traditional way of business processing with a resulted boost in productivity. In all these years the only constant thing in SAP.&nbsp; SAP-based applications are making business processes smooth for a long.</p><p><strong>Innoval Digital Solutions Pvt. Ltd.</strong> is a leading name in the SAP solutions landscape. Innoval Digital Solutions Pvt. Ltd. is empowering businesses with their cutting-edge and comprehensive technology offerings.</p><p>In an interview with Mr. Sunil Gupta, CEO, and Director of Innoval Digital Solutions Pvt. Ltd. let’s discover their journey since inception and more about their quality offerings</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tell us about your journey.</h2><p>It has been an interesting journey for me with respect to starting up, selling, and re-acquiring – IVL.</p><p>I was working with Siemens and was involved in several key technology initiatives of IT strategy, standardization of technology, applications, and infrastructure across various factories, businesses, and offices of Innoval Digital Solutions Pvt. Ltd. SAP was also one of my major activities.</p><p>Way back in 1995, some of the Germans approached me to start up an offshore company focused on SAP for serving the European market. This was the beginning and I took the risk.</p><p>TechnoPark based in Trivandrum was selected to be the location for setting up the company. Even though language, culture, and familiarity of Kerala were a challenge, I was extremely impressed with the world-class infrastructure, talent availability, costs of operations, and quality of life.</p><p>Within, a short span of time, we were able to recruit, train, expand, and start delivering cutting-edge solutions to the customers in Germany.</p><p>The business from Germany was constant and didn’t grow; hence I started looking for other geographies. India was a logical choice, and SAP ERP was being implemented in a few large companies in 1997. Being already present, we worked on several SAP implementations in India. This also gave us a good understanding of the functionality gap that was existing in SAP for Indian customers, especially in the areas of statutory compliance, taxation, and international trade areas. I always wanted to develop products and saw the opportunity to develop an Add-on for SAP for this functional gap, to address the pain points of Indian enterprises.</p><p>The product was named OptiSuite, certified by SAP, and became a huge success and implemented in a large number of companies in India.</p><p>Around 1998, SAP India was formed and we participated in developing the India version for SAP. We also worked on extensive consulting opportunities with SAP labs and other implementation partners across the globe. Fast forward to 2008, I sold the company to US-based company Collabera – which was later called Brillio.</p><p>As they say, the world is round, in July 2018, I got the opportunity to buy back the company from Brillio. During the same time, I also acquired two other company’s businesses called Saturn Systems and HBS. All the three were merged into what we called now Innoval Digital Solutions (IVL 2.0)</p><p>The mandate and plan for this new avatar are to help companies in large-scale digital transformation solutions, building intelligent enterprises using SAP and digital technologies.</p><p>IVL is an SAP partner since the last 25+ years; developing SAP-based certified add-on products and providing various application management services.</p><p>IVL is an SAP partner since the last 25+ years; developing SAP-based certified add-on products and providing various application management services. Over several years of participation in more than 2800+ SAP projects, acquired extensive experience in providing solutions, services, and support of SAP customers of leading corporates in the majority of industry verticals.</p><p>IVL has helped more than 350+ companies in India in providing Certified SAP Add-on products for statutory compliance and documentation. These products are part of OptiSuite 10, which has received its 14th year of certification and the latest version was launched in SAP TechED 2018 at Bangalore.</p><p>IVL has built large competency in Cloud technologies, building Fiori apps, HANA database applications that can help various organizations for migration, extension, and building solutions using SAP Cloud Platform (SCP-ABAP), Advance compliance reporting platform (ACR),&nbsp; SAP ECC, S/4HANA, or S/4HANA cloud version.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Innoval Digital Solutions Pvt.
