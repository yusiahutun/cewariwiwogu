Ekaterina hasn't been caught yet.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Last year a High Court judge ruled that Ms Barrett must hand over £1.6million to Ms Hutchcroft to repay the loan and cover legal costs after she failed to honour an agreement to pay back the money.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Ms Hutchcroft has now had to hire private investigators to track down the 'heiress' as not a penny has yet been handed over.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She could be anywhere. Some people I know say they saw her recently around Mayfair, but I expect she's living permanently in Monaco,' she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Barrett looked the part when she began visiting Pandora boutique in 2017. She mingled with London's elite in exclusive restaurants, lived in a £4.2million Mayfair flat and was driven around town in a Bentley.</p><img id=i-830dee5f0e778d7c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/06/04/22/71756115-12158361-Over_the_decades_the_boutique_in_Knightsbridge_has_counted_Princ-a-3_1685912671117.jpg height=997 width=634 alt="Over the decades, the boutique in Knightsbridge has counted Princess Diana (pictured), Catherine Zeta-Jones and Ava Gardner among its clientele" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Over the decades, the boutique in Knightsbridge has counted Princess Diana (pictured), Catherine Zeta-Jones and Ava Gardner among its clientele</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She told Ms Hutchcroft that her grandfather had set up 'a substantial trust for her in Liechtenstein' but she temporarily could not access the funds, according to documents filed at the High Court.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A few months into their friendship, Ms Barrett sobbed that she was going through a costly divorce and asked to borrow money.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her bank manager provided assurances to Ms Hutchcroft that her wealth was 'equivalent to a Rothschild', the court heard. But Ms Hutchcroft began having doubts after realising how much she had lent her friend.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: 'I just got to a point where I had to sit down and work out actually how much I'd given her over the year, and I was shocked at how much I'd allowed this person to take.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I phoned her and said, 'You've got to pay me Ekaterina.' And she said, 'The next time you ask I'll not pay you for a hundred years.' I was just so upset. I trusted her, ridiculously so.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To her horror, Ms Hutchcroft then learned that Ms Barrett had previously been convicted of fraud in Austria.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She contacted Scotland Yard but officers refused to investigate, saying it was a civil matter.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Then she filed a claim in the High Court, where Ms Barrett denied borrowing the cash, claiming the payments were for the sale of designer clothes. The case was settled before trial when Ms Barrett agreed to pay £1.4million.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But when she failed to pay up, Ms Hutchcroft returned to court and secured a judge's ruling that she must pay £1.6million.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Barrett is an Azerbaijani national who was born in Ukraine in 1956 as Ekaterina Svetikova. She married British artist Mitchel Barrett in 2000 and they moved to Vienna, Austria.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But four years later, she was convicted of fraud after posing as an oil firm agent to con victims into loaning her 200,000 euros.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her passport was confiscated and she was banned from entering Austria for almost a decade.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Barrett, now her former husband, said: 'I'd been warned by friends to get away from her. The next thing I knew was the police came to our apartment and arrested her.' When asked about her fraud conviction, Ms Barrett's lawyers denied she had been arrested. Faced with evidence, they admitted the conviction but claimed it had been overturned.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Hutchcroft believes Ms Barrett owns the apartment in Monaco, which is now on sale for £19.2million. However, Ms Barrett denies she is the property's owner and said she is a UK tax resident.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A representative said Ms Barrett had not admitted any liability by reaching a settlement with Ms Hutchcroft, that the legal proceedings were 'ongoing' and she would comply with court orders 'in so far as she is able'.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Bc32UcWpvaV%2BAu6qzx62qm6qZmbSmecGorK2hoaqybq7OrKpmbmNisLC6zZ6bZmldaLqquMuipqdloqq7osPAsmShnZmnsrS%2FjaGrpqQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./lethal-men-dangerously-irresistible-women-50-years-death-ladies-man-bruce-lee-cut-swath-hollywoods-famous-beautiful-tom-leonard-reveals-fleeting-lusty-life-kung-fu-legend-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Lethal to men, dangerously irresistible to women: 50 years after his death how ladies' man Bruce Lee</a>
